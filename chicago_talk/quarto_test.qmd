[**Article A**](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/01/world/europe/01prexy.html?searchResultPosition=11):

<!-- President Vladimir V. Putin told Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, on Saturday to continue selling subsidized gas to Ukraine until the end of March if Ukraine agrees to pay market prices beginning in April. Mr. Putin's order, delivered on national television as Gazprom threatened to cut off gas exports for Ukraine beginning on Jan. 1, put Russia's president in the center of a dispute that has caused Europe to worry whether its gas supply will be disrupted in the January chill. Ukraine replied warily. The office of President Viktor A. Yushchenko noted that ''negotiations of the settlement of the gas problem have crossed into a new phase.'' A spokesman for Yury I. Yekhanurov, Ukraine's prime minister, was quoted by Interfax saying that Ukraine agreed to a transition to market prices, but the details require negotiations. Mr. Putin gave Ukraine until midnight Saturday to accept his terms. -->
