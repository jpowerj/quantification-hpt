[**Article A**](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/01/world/europe/01prexy.html?searchResultPosition=11):

<!-- President Vladimir V. Putin told Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, on Saturday to continue selling subsidized gas to Ukraine until the end of March if Ukraine agrees to pay market prices beginning in April. Mr. Putin's order, delivered on national television as Gazprom threatened to cut off gas exports for Ukraine beginning on Jan. 1, put Russia's president in the center of a dispute that has caused Europe to worry whether its gas supply will be disrupted in the January chill. Ukraine replied warily. The office of President Viktor A. Yushchenko noted that ''negotiations of the settlement of the gas problem have crossed into a new phase.'' A spokesman for Yury I. Yekhanurov, Ukraine's prime minister, was quoted by Interfax saying that Ukraine agreed to a transition to market prices, but the details require negotiations. Mr. Putin gave Ukraine until midnight Saturday to accept his terms. -->

## Constructing Contextual Fields

* Word2Vec
* BERT



<!-- 	\caption{A visualization of \BERT{}'s ability to model the different contexts (and thus, senses) in which words are used by different authors. In this case \texttt{interference} falls squarely within the negative liberty (liberty as non-interference) cluster, as a term central to distinguishing negative from other forms of liberty, whereas \texttt{absence} falls between two clusters as it can be employed in both republican (``absence of arbitrary power'') and negative-liberty (``absence of interference'') contexts.}

* "$X$ influenced $Y$"? Let's zoom in on **mechanisms**:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

* **Collaboration**: "Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels carried on one of the great intellectual collaborations in the history of scientific research." [@gandy_marx_1979, p. ii]
  <!-- * $\newcommand{\entity}[1]{\small \verb+#1+} \implies \textsf{Collaboration}(\entity{Karl Marx}, \text{ }\entity{Friedrich Engels})$ -->
* **Mentorship**: for example, "the grandly-titled \textit{Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus} was begun in 1915 following Wittgenstein's tenure at Cambridge under [Bertrand] Russell's mentorship" [@wright_schoenberg_2006, p. 72]
  <!-- * $\implies \textsf{Mentorship}(\entity{Bertrand Russell},\text{ }\entity{Ludwig Wittgenstein})$ -->
* **Reading**: for example, ``Not only had Marx read Hegel's \textit{Logic} in 1858, but we know that he studied it once again in 1860.'' [@dussel_unknown_2002, p. 195]
  <!-- * $\implies \textsf{Reading}(\entity{Karl Marx},\text{ } \entity{G.W.F. Hegel})$ -->

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

* **Shared Intellectual Community**: "Schelling and Hegel first met at the TÃ¼bingen Seminary in 1790, and the two young men shared a room there during their student years" [@levine_divergent_2006, p. 124]
  <!-- * $\implies \textsf{Shared-Intellectual-Community}(\entity{F.W.J. Schelling},\text{ }\entity{G.W.F. Hegel})$ -->
* **Shared Geography**: for example, ``Lenin was an occasional visitor in Vienna. Hitler, like Trotsky, had lived there for years." [@morton_thunder_1990, p. 290]
  <!-- * $\implies \textsf{Shared-Geography}(\entity{V.I. Lenin},\text{ }\entity{Adolf Hitler})$ -->
* **Rivalry**: for example, ``the cultural philosophy of the Historical School and, more particularly, of Hegel's rival at the University of Berlin, Friedrich Schleiermacher." [@toews_hegelianism_1985, p. 7]
  <!-- * $\implies \textsf{Rivalry}(\entity{G.W.F. Hegel},\text{ }\entity{Friedrich Schleiermacher})$ -->
