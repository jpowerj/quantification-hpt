<!-- President Vladimir V. Putin told Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, on Saturday to continue selling subsidized gas to Ukraine until the end of March if Ukraine agrees to pay market prices beginning in April. Mr. Putin's order, delivered on national television as Gazprom threatened to cut off gas exports for Ukraine beginning on Jan. 1, put Russia's president in the center of a dispute that has caused Europe to worry whether its gas supply will be disrupted in the January chill. Ukraine replied warily. The office of President Viktor A. Yushchenko noted that ''negotiations of the settlement of the gas problem have crossed into a new phase.'' A spokesman for Yury I. Yekhanurov, Ukraine's prime minister, was quoted by Interfax saying that Ukraine agreed to a transition to market prices, but the details require negotiations. Mr. Putin gave Ukraine until midnight Saturday to accept his terms. -->

<h1>Section 2: Models of Meaning and Context</h1>
:::

* How can we adapt tools from *computer science* to allow *social scientists* and *humanists* to make meaningful (context-sensitve!) inferences?

<!-- "However, the knowledge transfer from computer science and related fields has created confusion in how text as data models are applied, how they are validated, and how their output is interpreted. This confusion emerges because tasks in academic computer science are different than the tasks in social science, the digital humanities, and even parts of industry. While computer scientists are often (but not exclusively!) interested in information retrieval, recommendation systems, and benchmark linguistic tasks, a different community is interested in using “text as data” to learn about previously studied phenomena such as in social science, literature, and history. Despite these differences of purpose, text as data practitioners have tended to reflexively adopt the guidance from the computer science literature when doing their own work. This blind importing of the default methods and practices used to select, evaluate, and validate models from the computer science literature can lead to unintended consequences." -->

  <!-- * $\implies \textsf{Mentorship}(\entity{Bertrand Russell},\text{ }\entity{Ludwig Wittgenstein})$ -->
* **Reading**: "Not only had [Marx]{.entity} read [Hegel]{.entity}'s *Logic* in 1858, but we know that he studied it once again in 1860." [@dussel_unknown_2002, p. 195]

* The bad news: Europe no longer the location of the inevitable worker's revolution...
