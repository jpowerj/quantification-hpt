	\caption{A visualization of \BERT{}'s ability to model the different contexts (and thus, senses) in which words are used by different authors. In this case \texttt{interference} falls squarely within the negative liberty (liberty as non-interference) cluster, as a term central to distinguishing negative from other forms of liberty, whereas \texttt{absence} falls between two clusters as it can be employed in both republican (``absence of arbitrary power'') and negative-liberty (``absence of interference'') contexts.}
