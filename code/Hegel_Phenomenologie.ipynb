    "[In the preceding section there is analysed the attempt on the part of\n",
    "individuality to operate as its own legislator and judge of laws holding\n",
    "for individuals. Individuality may claim the privilege of enunciating\n",
    "laws universal in character but having their source and inspiration solely in\n",
    "the single individual. Such laws can at best only be regulative and\n",
    "cannot be constitutive of the substance of individuality ; for the substance of individuality necessarily involves other individuals within it.\n",
    "In short individuality is itself only realised as a part of a concrete whole\n",
    "of individuals : its life is drawn from common life in and with others.\n",
    "To attempt to enunciate laws from itself as if it could create the conditions\n",
    "of its own inherent universality can only issue in one result : laws are\n",
    "furnished without the content which gives those laws any meaning, or else\n",
    "the laws and the content remain from first to last external to one another.\n",
    "But if laws are purely formal, they cease to be \"laws,\" i.e. constitutive\n",
    "conditions of individuality. Hence the attempt above described is sure\n",
    "to break down by its own futility. What is wanted to give the laws\n",
    "meaning is the concrete substance of social life : and when this concrete\n",
    "substance is provided ipso facto the attempt of individuality to create\n",
    "laws disappears, for these laws are already found in operation in social life.\n",
    "Only such laws have reality. But this involves the further step that individuality is only realised, only finds its true universal content, in and\n",
    "with the order of a society. Here alone is individuality what it is in\n",
    "truth, at once a particular focus of self-consciousness, and a realisation of\n",
    "universal mind. This condition where individuality is conscious of itself\n",
    "only in and with others, and conscious of the common life as its own, is\n",
    "the stage of spiritual existence. Spiritual existence and social life thus go\n",
    "together. The following section begins the analysis of this phase of\n",
    "experience, which extends from the simplest form of sociality the Family\n",
    "up to the highest experience of universal mind Keligioii.\n",
    "\n",
    "The immediately succeeding section may be taken as the keystone of\n",
    "t\" e whole arch of experience traversed in the Phenomenology. Here it is\n",
    "pointed out that all the preceding phases of experience have not merely\n",
    "been preparing the way for what is to follow, but that the various aspects,\n",
    "hitherto treated as separate moments of experience, are in reality abstractions from the life of concrete spirit now to be discussed and analysed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is noteworthy that from this point onwards the argument is less\n",
    "negative in its result either directly or indirectly, and is more systematic\n",
    "and constructive. This is no doubt largely because hitherto individual\n",
    "mind as such has been under review, and this is an abstraction from social\n",
    "mind or spiritual existence.]\n",
    "\n",
    "REASON is spirit, when its certainty of being all reality\n",
    "has been raised to the level of truth, and reason\n",
    "is consciously aware of itself as its own world, and of the\n",
    "world as itself. The development of spirit was indicated\n",
    "in the iTnTnp.fHfl.tp.ly preceding movement of mind,\n",
    "where the object of consciousness, the category pure\n",
    "and simple, rose to be the notion of reason. When\n",
    "reason \" observes/' this pure unity of ego and existence,\n",
    "the unity of subjectivity and objectivity, of for-itself-ness\n",
    "and in-itself-ness this unity is immanent, has the\n",
    "character of implicitness or of being ; and consciousness\n",
    "of reason finds itself. But the true nature of \" observa-\n",
    "tion \" is rather the transcendence of this instinct of\n",
    "finding its object lying directly at hand, and passing\n",
    "beyond this unconscious state of existence. The directly\n",
    "perceived (angeschauf) category, the thing simply\n",
    "\"found,\" enters consciousness as the self-existence of the\n",
    "ego, ego, which now knows itself in the objective realit)',\n",
    "and knows itself there as the self. But this feature of\n",
    "the category, viz. of being for-itself as opposed to\n",
    "being immanent within itself, is equally one-sided,\n",
    "and a moment that cancels itself. The category\n",
    "therefore gets for consciousness the character which it\n",
    "possesses in its universal truth it is self-contained essential reality (an und fursichseyndes Weseri). This\n",
    "character, still abstract, which constitutes the nature\n",
    "of absolute fact, of \"fact itself,\" is to begin with\n",

    "laws or pretends to possess within its own knowledge\n",
    "as such the laws as they absolutely are (an und fur sick),\n",

    "ness of its own self. The self-contained and self-suffi-\n",
    "cient reality, however, which is at once aware of being\n",
    "actual in the form of consciousness and presents itself\n",
    "to itself, is Spirit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its essential spirtual being (Wesen) has been above\n",
    "designated as the ethical substance ; spirit, however,\n",
    "is concrete ethical actuality (Wirklichkeit). Spirit is the\n",
    "self of the actual consciousness, to which spirit stands\n",
    "opposed, or rather which appears over against itself, as\n",
    "an objective actual world that has lost, however, all\n",
    "sense of strangeness for the self, just as the self has lost\n",
    "all sense of having a dependent or independent existence\n",
    "by itself, cut off and separated from that world.\n",
    "Being substance and universal self-identical permanent\n",
    "essence (Wesen), spirit is the immovable irreducible\n",
    "basis and the starting point for the action of all and\n",
    "every one ; it is their purpose and their goal, because\n",
    "the ideally implicit nature (Ansich) of all self-consciousnesses. This substance is likewise the universal product,\n",
    "wrought and created by the action of each and all, and\n",

    "for it is self -existence (Fursichseyri), the self, action.\n",
    "Qua substance^seKrvY- ^ oHibending righteous self-sameness, self-identity ; but qua for-itself, self-existent and\n",
    "self-determined, its continuity is resolved\n",
    "into discrete elements, it is the self-sacrificing soul of\n",
    "goodness, the benevolent essential nature, in which\n",
    "each fulfils his own special work, rends the continuum\n",
    "of the universal substance, and takes his own share\n",
    "of it. This resolution of the essence into individual\n",
    "forms is just the aspect of the separate action and the\n",
    "separate self of all the several individuals ; it is the\n",
    "moving soul of the ethical substance, the resultant\n",
    "universal spiritual being. Just because this substance\n",
    "is a being resolved in the self, it is not a lifeless\n",
    "essence, but actual and alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spirit is thus the self-supporting absolutely real\n",
    "ultimate being (Weseri). All the previous modes of\n",
    "consciousness are abstractions from it : they are\n",
    "constituted by the fact that spirit analyses itself,\n",
    "distinguishes its moments, and halts at each individual\n",
    "mode in turn. The isolating of such moments pre-supposes spirit itself and requires spirit for its subsistence, in other words, this isolation of modes only exists\n",
    "within spirit, which is existence. Taken in isolation\n",
    "they appear as if they existed as they stand. But their\n",
    "advance and return upon their real ground and essential\n",
    "being showed that they are merely moments or vanishing\n",
    "quantities; and this essential being is precisely this movement and resolution of these moments. Here, where\n",
    "spirit, the reflection of these moments into itself, has become established, our reflection may briefly recall\n",
    "them in this connexion : they were consciousness, self-consciousness, and reason. Spirit is thus Consciousness\n",
    "in general, which contains sense-experience, perception\n",
    "and understanding, so far as in analysing its own self it\n",
    "holds fast by the moment of being a reality objective\n",
    "to itself, and by abstraction eliminates the fact that this\n",
    "reality is its own self objectified, its own self-existence.\n",
    "When again it holds fast by the other abstract moment\n",
    "produced by analysis, the fact that its object is its own\n",
    "self become objective to itself, is its self-existence, then it\n",
    "is Self-consciousness. But as immediate consciousness of\n",
    "its inherent and its explicit being, of its immanent self\n",
    "and its objective self, as the unity of consciousness and\n",
    "self-consciousness, it is that type of consciousness\n",
    "which h * Reason: it is the consciousness which, as\n",
    "the word have \" indicates, has the object in a shape\n",
    "which is implicitly and inherently rational, or is cate-\n",
    "gorised, but in such a way that the object is not yet\n",
    "taken by the consciousness in question to have the\n",
    "value of a category. Spirit here is that consciousness\n",
    "from the immediately preceding consideration of which\n",
    "we have arrived at the present stage. Finally, when\n",
    "this reason, which spirit \" has,\" is seen by spirit to be\n",
    "reason which actually is, to be reason which is actual\n",
    "in spirit, and is its world, then spirit has come to its\n",
    "truth ; it is spirit, the essential nature of ethical life\n",
    "actually existent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spirit, so far as it is the immediate truth, is the\n",
    "ethical life of a nation : the individual, which is a\n",
    "world. It has to advance to the consciousness of\n",
    "what it is immediately ; it has to abandon and transcend\n",
    "the beautiful simplicity of ethical life, and get to a knowledge of itself by passing through a series of stages\n",
    "and forms. The distinction between these and those\n",
    "that have gone before consists in their being real\n",
    "spiritual individualities (Geister), actualities proper, and\n",
    "instead of being forms of consciousness, they are forms\n",
    "of a world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The living ethical world is spirit in its truth. As it\n",
    "first comes to an abstract knowledge of its essential\n",
    "nature, ethical life (Sittlichkeit) is destroyed in the\n",
    "formal universality of right or legality (Recht). Spirit,\n",
    "being now sundered within itself, traces one of its worlds\n",
    "in the element of its objectivity as in a crass solid\n",
    "actuality ; this is the realm of Culture and Civilisation ;\n",
    "while over against this in the element of thought is\n",
    "traced the world of Belief or Faith, the realm of the\n",
    "Inner Life and Truth (Wesen). Both worlds -However,\n",
    "when in the grip of the notion when gasped by\n",
    "spirit which, after this loss of self through self-diremption, penetrates itself, are thrown into con-\n",
    "fusion and revolutionised through individual Insight\n",
    "(Einsickt), and the general diffusion of this attitude,\n",
    "known as the \" Enlightenment \" (Aufkldrung). And the\n",
    "realm which had thus been divided and expanded into\n",
    "the \"present \" and the \"remote beyond,\" into .the \"here\"\n",
    "and the \" yonder,\" turns back into self-consciousness.\n",
    "This self-consciousness, again, taking now the form of\n",
    "Morality (the inner moral life) apprehends itself as the\n",
    "essential truth, and the real essence as its actual self :\n",
    "no longer puts its world and its ground and basis away\n",
    "outside itself, but lets everything fade into itself, and\n",
    "in the form of Conscience (Gewissen) is spirit sure and\n",
    "certain (gewiss) of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ethical world, the world rent asunder into the \" here \" and the \" yonder,\" and the moral point of view\n",
    "(moralische Weltanschauung) are, then, individual forms\n",
    "of spirit (Geister) whose process and whose return\n",
    "into the self of spirit, a self simple and self-existent\n",
    "(fursichseynd), will be developed. When these attain\n",
    "their goal and final result, the actual self-consciousness\n",
    "of Absolute Spirit will make its appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spirit, in its ultimate simple truth, is consciousness,\n",
    "and breaks asunder its moments from one another.\n",
    "An act divides spirit into spiritual substance on the\n",
    "one side, and consciousness of the substance on the\n",
    "other ; and divides the substance as well as conscious-\n",
    "ness. The substance appears in the shape of a universal\n",
    "inner nature and purpose standing in contrast to itself\n",
    "qua particularised reality. The middle or mediating\n",
    "term, infinite in character, is self-consciousness, which,\n",
    "being implicitly the unity of itself and that substance,\n",
    "becomes so, now, explicitly, unites the universal\n",
    "inner nature and its particular realisation, raises the\n",
    "latter to the former and becomes ethical action : and,\n",
    "on the other hand, brings the former down to the latter\n",
    "and carries out the purpose, the substance presented\n",
    "merely in thought. In this way it brings to light the\n",
    "unity of its self and the substance, and produces this\n",
    "unity in the form of a \"work\" done, and thus as actual\n",
    "concrete fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "When consciousness breaks up into these elements,\n",
    "the simple substance has in part preserved the attitude\n",
    "of opposition to self-consciousness ; in part it thereby\n",
    "manifests in itself the very nature of consciousness,\n",
    "which consists in distinguishing its own content within itself, manifests a world articulated into separate\n",
    "areas. The substance is thus an ethical being\n",
    "split up into distinct elemental forms, a human and\n",
    "a divine law. In the same way, the self-consciousness appearing over against the substance assigns itself,\n",
    "in virtue of its inner nature, to one of these powers,\n",
    "and, qua involving knowledge, gets broken up into\n",
    "ignorance of what it is doing on the one hand,\n",
    "and knowledge of this on the other, a knowledge which\n",
    "for that reason proves a deception. It learns, therefore,\n",
    "through its own act at once the contradictory nature of\n",
    "those powers into which the inner substance divided itself, and their mutual overthrow, as well as the contradiction between its knowledge of the ethical character of\n",
    "its act and what is truly and essentially ethical, and so\n",
    "finds its own destruction. In point of fact, however,\n",
    "the ethical substance has by this process become actual\n",
    "concrete self-consciousness : in other words this particular self has become self-sufficient and self-dependent, but precisely thereby the\n",
    "ethical order has been overthrown and destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The first step in the analysis of spirit is to take spirit as a realised actual\n",
    "social order, immediately given as a historical fact, and present directly to\n",
    "the minds of the individuals composing it. This is social life as an established routine of human adjustments, where the natural characteristics and\n",
    "constitution of its moral individuals are absorbed and built into the single\n",
    "substance of the living social whole. It is spirit as an objectively\n",
    "embodied whole of essentially spiritual individuals, without any consciousness of opposition to one another or to the whole, and with an\n",
    "absolute unbroken sense of their own security and fulfilment within\n",
    "the substance of social mind. It is spirit at the level of naive acquiescence in the law and order of conventional life.\n",
    "\n",
    "But such a self-complete type of experience has various levels of\n",
    "realisation. It cannot exist except through the union of opposing\n",
    "elements ; and the central principle of all experience, self-consciousness,\n",
    "which assumes here such a concrete form, has abundant material on which\n",
    "to exercise its function of creating and imiting distinctions. The first\n",
    "level is determined by the fact that the substance of social life is constituted out of the quasi-natural phenomena of human genus and species,\n",
    "of race and nationality, on the one hand, and the purely natural element\n",
    "of specialised individual sex on the other. These two aspects go together ;\n",
    "the sex-relations of individuals maintain race and nationality, the nation\n",
    "lives in and through its sexually distinct individuals. The social order as\n",
    "an order is realised and maintained in the medium of these elements.\n",
    "The fact that this order is an order of universal mind gives it a permanence, an inviolability, an absoluteness, which are inseparable from it,\n",
    "so inseparable that the order is looked on as having its roots in the\n",
    "Absolute Mind, and as deriving its authority from it. The social order on\n",
    "this aspect consists of a divinely established and divinely sanctioned\n",
    "regime; the gods are the guardians of the city, of the hearth and the\n",
    "home. On the other hand the expression of this order varies, and is\n",
    "enunciated from time to time in the history of a community. The\n",
    "order in this sense is made by man ; the law of the social order thus\n",
    "becomes a human law, determined by human conditions and human ends;\n",
    "it is a round of conventions and customs. These two forms of order are\n",
    "inseparable in the life of a community, and they subsist together and side by side at this level of social consciousness. They may lead to conflict in\n",
    "the life of the individual in the community, and have to be reconciled by\n",
    "force or otherwise ; and they become associated and connected with the\n",
    "fundamental differences of individuality above referred to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of this level of social life constituted as above furnishes\n",
    "the argument of the following section.]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "THE ETHICAL WORLD ; LAW HUMAN AND DIVINE ; MAN AND WOMAN\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple substance of spirit, being consciousness,\n",
    "divides itself into parts. In other words, just as consciousness of abstract sensuous existence passes over\n",
    "into perception, so does immediate certainty of real\n",
    "ethical existence ; and just as for sense perception\n",
    "bare \"being\" becomes a \"thing\" with many properties, so for ethical perception a given act becomes\n",
    "a reality involving many ethical relations. For the\n",
    "former, again, the unnecessary plurality of properties concentrates itself into the form of an essential\n",
    "opposition between individual and universal ; and\n",
    "still more for the latter, which is consciousness purified and substantial, the plurality of ethical moments\n",
    "is reduced to and assumes a twofold form, that of a law\n",
    "of individuality and a law of universality. Each of\n",
    "these areas or \" masses \" of the substance remains, however, spirit in its entirety. If in sense-perception\n",
    "\" things \" have no other substantial reality than the\n",
    "two determinations of individual and universal, these\n",
    "determinations express, in the present instance, merely\n",
    "the superficial opposition of both sides to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuality, in the case of the subject we\n",
    "are here considering, has the significance of self-consciousness in general, not of any particular consciousness\n",
    "we care to take. The ethical substance is, thus, in this determination actual concrete substance, Absolute Spirit\n",
    "realised in the plurality of distinct consciousnesses\n",
    "definitely existing. It [this spirit] is the community which, as we entered the stage of the\n",
    "practical embodiment of reason in general, came\n",
    "before us as the absolute and ultimate reality,\n",
    "and which here comes objectively before itself in its\n",
    "true nature as a conscious ethical reality (Wesen) and\n",
    "as the essential reality, for that mode of consciousness we are now dealing with. It is spirit which is\n",
    "for itself', since it maintains itself by being reflected in\n",
    "the minds of the component individuals ; and which\n",
    "is in itself or substance, since it preserves them within\n",
    "itself. Qua actual substance, that spirit is a Nation; qua concrete consciousness, it is the Citizens of\n",
    "a nation. This consciousness has its essential being in\n",
    "simple spirit, and is certain of itself in the actual\n",
    "realisation of this spirit, in the entire nation ; it has\n",
    "its truth there directly, not therefore in something\n",
    "unreal, but in a spirit which exists and makes itself\n",
    "felt.\n",
    "\n",
    "This spirit can be named Human Law, because it\n",
    "has its being essentially in the form of self-conscious actuality. In the form of universality, that\n",
    "spirit is law known to everybody, familiar and recognised, and is every-day present Customary Convention\n",
    "(Sitte) ; in the form of particularity it is the concrete\n",
    "certainty of itself in any and every individual ; and the\n",
    "certainty of itself as a single individuality is that spirit\n",
    "in the form of Government. Its true and complete\n",
    "nature is seen in its authoritative validity openly and\n",
    "unmistakably manifested, an existence which takes\n",
    "the form of unconstrained independent objective fact, and is immediately apprehended with conscious certainty in this form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over against this power and publicity of the ethical\n",
    "secular human order there appears, however, another\n",
    "power, the Divine Law. For the ethical power of the\n",
    "state, being the movement of self-conscious action,\n",
    "finds its opposition in the simple immediate essential being of the moral order ; qua actual concrete\n",
    "universality, it is a force exerted against the independence of the individual ; and, qua actuality in general,\n",
    "it finds inherent in that essential being something other\n",
    "than the power of the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We mentioned before that each of the opposite\n",
    "ways in which the ethical substance exists, contains\n",
    "that substance in its entirety, and contains all moments\n",
    "of its contents. If, then, the community is that substance in the form of self-consciously realised action,\n",
    "the other side has the form of immediate or directly\n",
    "existent substance. The latter is thus, on the one\n",
    "hand, the inner principle (Begriff) or universal possibility\n",
    "of the ethical order in general, but, on the other hand,\n",
    "contains within it also the moment of self-consciousness.\n",
    "This moment which expresses the ethical order in this\n",
    "element of immediacy or mere being, which, in other\n",
    "words, is an immediate consciousness of self (both as\n",
    "regards its essence and its particular thisness) in an\n",
    "\" other,\" and hence, is a natural ethical community\n",
    "this is the Family. The family, as the inner indwelling\n",
    "principle of sociality operating in an unconscious way,\n",
    "stands opposed to its own actuality when explicitly conscious ; as the basis of the actuality of a nation, it stands\n",
    "in contrast to the nation itself ; as the immediate ethical\n",
    "existence, it stands over against the ethical order which shapes and preserves itself by work for universal\n",
    "ends ; the Penates of the family stand in contrast to\n",
    "the universal spirit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the ethical existence of the family has the\n",
    "character of immediacy, it is within itself an ethical\n",
    "entity, but not so far as it is the natural relation of its\n",
    "component members, or so far as their connexion is one\n",
    "immediately holding between individual concrete beings.\n",
    "For the ethical element is intrinsically universal, and\n",
    "this relation established by nature is essentially just\n",
    "as much a spiritual fact, and is only ethical by being\n",
    "spiritual. Let us see wherein its peculiar ethical character consists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first place, because the ethical element is\n",
    "the intrinsically universal element, the ethical relation\n",
    "between the members of the family is not that of sentiment or the relationship of love. The ethical element in\n",
    "this case seems bound to be placed in the relation of the\n",
    "individual member of the family to the entire family\n",
    "as the real substance, so that the purpose of his action\n",
    "and the content of his actuality are taken from this\n",
    "substance, are derived solely from the family life.\n",
    "But the conscious purpose which dominates the action\n",
    "of this whole, so far as that purpose concerns that\n",
    "whole, is itself the individual member. The procuring\n",
    "and maintaining of power and wealth turn, in part,\n",
    "merely on needs and wants, and are a matter that has\n",
    "to do with desire ; in part, they become in their higher\n",
    "aspect something which is merely of mediate significance.\n",
    "This aspect does not fall within the family itself, but\n",

    "Finally, just as little should we take it that the service\n",

    "of a mere particular individual : it has as its object and\n",

    "The present course of lectures deals with ‘Aesthetic’.\n",
    "Their subject is the wide realm of the beautiful, and, more particularly, their province is Art – we may restrict it, indeed, to Fine Art.\n",
    "The name ‘Aesthetic’ in its natural sense is not quite appropriate to this subject.\n",
    "‘Aesthetic’ means more precisely the science of sensation or feeling.\n",
    "Thus understood, it arose as a new science, or rather as something that was to become a branch of philosophy for the first time, in the school of Wolff, at the epoch when works of art were being considered in Germany in the light of the feelings which they were supposed to evoke – feelings of pleasure, admiration, fear, pity, etc.\n",
    "The name was so inappropriate, or, strictly speaking, so superficial, that for this reason it was attempted to form other names, e.g. ‘Kallistic’.\n",
    "But this name, again, is unsatisfactory, for the science to be designated does not treat of beauty in general, but merely of artistic beauty.\n",
    "We shall, therefore, permit the name Aesthetic to stand, because it is nothing but a name, and so is indifferent to us, and, moreover, has up to a certain point passed into common language.\n",
    "As a name, therefore, it may be retained.\n",
    "The proper expression, however, for our science is the ‘Philosophy of Art’, or, more definitely, the ‘Philosophy of Fine Art’.\n",
    "By the above expression we at once exclude the beauty of Nature.\n",
    "Such a limitation of our subject may appear to be an arbitrary demarcation, resting on the principle that every science has the prerogative of marking out its boundaries at pleasure.\n",
    "But this is not the sense in which we are to understand the limitation of Aesthetic to the beauty of art.\n",
    "It is true that in common life we are in the habit of speaking of beautiful colour, a beautiful sky, a beautiful river, and, moreover, of beautiful flowers, beautiful animals, and, above all, of beautiful human beings.\n",
    "We will not just now enter into the controversy how far such objects can justly have the attribute of beauty ascribed to them, or how far, speaking generally, natural beauty ought to be recognized as existing besides artistic beauty.\n",
    "We may, however, begin at once by asserting that artistic beauty stands higher than nature.\n",
    "For the beauty of art is the beauty that is born – born again, that is – of the mind; and by as much as the mind and its products are higher than nature and its appearances, by so much the beauty of art is higher than the beauty of nature.\n",
    "Indeed, if we look at it formally – i.e. only considering in what way it exists, not what there is in it – even a silly fancy such as may pass through a man’s head is higher than any product of nature; for such a fancy must at least be characterized by intellectual being and by freedom.\n",
    "In respect of its content, on the other hand, the sun, for instance, appears to us to be an absolutely necessary factor in the universe, while a blundering notion passes away as accidental and transient; but yet, in its own being, a natural existence such as the sun is indifferent, is not free or self-conscious, while if we consider it in its necessary connection with other things we are not regarding it by itself or for its own sake, and, therefore, not as beautiful.\n",
    "To say, as we have said, in general terms, that mind and its artistic beauty stand higher than natural beauty is no doubt to determine almost nothing.\n",
    "For ‘higher’ is an utterly indefinite expression, which designates the beauty of nature and that of art as if merely standing side by side in the space of the imagination, and states the difference between them as purely quantitative, and, therefore, purely external.\n",
    "But the mind and its artistic beauty, in being 'higher' as compared with nature, have a distinction which is not simply relative.\n",
    "Mind, and mind only, is capable of truth, and comprehends in itself all that is, so that whatever is beautiful can only be really and truly beautiful as partaking in this higher element and as created thereby.\n",
    "In this sense the beauty of nature reveals itself as but a reflection of the beauty which belongs to the mind, as an imperfect, incomplete mode of being, as a mode whose really substantial element is contained in the mind itself.\n",
    "Moreover, we shall find the restriction to fine art very natural, for however much has been and is said – though less by the ancients than by ourselves – of the beauties of nature, yet no one has taken it into his head to emphasize the point of view of the beauty of natural objects, and to attempt to make a science, a systematic account of these beauties.\n",
    "The aspect of Utility, indeed, has been accentuated, and a science, e.g. of natural things useful against diseases, a materia medica, has been compiled, consisting in a description of minerals, chemical products, plants, and animals that are of use for curative purposes.\n",
    "But the realm of nature has not been arrayed and estimated under the aspect of beauty.\n",
    "In dealing with natural beauty we find ourselves too open to vagueness, and too destitute of a criterion; for which reason such a review would have little interest.\n",
    "The above prefatory remarks upon beauty in nature and in art, upon the relation between the two, and the exclusion of the former from the region of the subject proper, are meant to remove any idea that the limitation of our science is owing merely to choice and to caprice.\n",
    "But this is not the place to demonstrate the above relation, for the consideration of it falls within our science itself, and therefore it cannot be discussed and demonstrated till later.\n",
    "Supposing that for the present we have limited ourselves to the beauty of art, this first step brings us at once into contact with fresh difficulties.\n",
    "The first thing that may suggest itself to us is the difficulty whether fine art shows itself to deserve a scientific treatment.\n",
    "Beauty and art, no doubt, pervade all the business of life like a kindly genius, and form the bright adornment of all our surroundings, both mental and material, soothing the sadness of our condition and the embarrassments of real life, killing time in entertaining fashion, and where there is nothing good to be achieved, occupying the place of what is vicious, better, at any rate, than vice.\n",
    "Yet although art presses in with its pleasing shapes on every possible occasion, from the rude adornments of the savage to the splendour of the temple with its untold wealth of decoration, still these shapes themselves appear to fall outside the real purposes of life.\n",
    "And even if the creations of art do not prove detrimental to our graver purposes, if they appear at times actually to further them by keeping evil at a distance, still it is so far true that art belongs rather to the relaxation and leisure of the mind, while the substantive interests of life demand its exertion.\n",
    "Hence it may seem unsuitable and pedantic to treat with scientific seriousness what is not in itself of a serious nature.\n",
    "In any case, upon such a view art appears as a superfluity, even if the softening of the mental temper which preoccupation with beauty has power to produce does not turn out a detrimental, because effeminating influence.\n",
    "In this aspect of the matter, the fine arts being granted to be a luxury, it has been thought necessary in various ways to take up their defence with reference to their relation towards practical necessities, and more especially towards morality and piety; and, as it is impossible to demonstrate their harmlessness, at least to make it credible that the mental luxury in question afforded a larger sum of advantages than of disadvantages.\n",
    "With this view very serious aims have been ascribed to art, and it has been recommended in various ways as a mediator between reason and sensuousness, between inclination and duty, as the reconciler of these elements in the obstinate conflict and repulsion which their collision generates.\n",
    "But the opinion may be maintained that, assuming such aims of art, more serious though they are, nothing is gained for reason and duty by the attempt at mediation, because these principles, as essentially incapable of intermixture, can be parties to no such compromise, but demand in their manifestation the same purity which they have in themselves.\n",
    "And it might be said that art itself is not made any more worthy of scientific discussion by such treatment, seeing that it is still doubly a servant – to higher aims, no doubt, on the one hand, but none the less to vacuity and frivolity on the other; and in such service can at best only display itself as a means, instead of being an end pursued for its own sake.\n",
    "Finally, art, considered as a means, seems to labour under this defect of form, that, supposing it to be subordinated to serious ends, and to produce results of importance, still the means employed by art for such purposes is deception.\n",
    "For beauty has its being in appearance.\n",
    "Now, it will readily be admitted that an aim which is real and true in itself ought not to be attained by deception, and if it does here and there achieve some success in this way, that can only be the case to a limited extent, and even then deception cannot approve itself as the right means.\n",
    "For the means should correspond to the dignity of the end, and only what is real and true, not semblance or deception, has power to create what is real and true; just as science, for instance, has to consider the true interests of the mind in accordance with the truth of reality and the true way of conceiving it.\n",
    "In all these respects it may appear as if fine art were unworthy of scientific consideration; because, as is alleged, it is at best a pleasing amusement, and even if it pursues more serious aims is in contradiction with their nature, but is at best the mere servant alike of amusement and of serious aims, and yet has at command, whether as the element of its being or as the vehicle of its action, nothing beyond deception and semblance.\n",
    "But, in the second place, it is a still more probable aspect of the question that, even if fine art were to form a subject of philosophical reflections in a general way, it would be no appropriate matter for strictly scientific treatment.\n",
    "The beauty of art presents itself to sense, to feeling, to perception, to imagination; its sphere is not that of thought, and the apprehension of its activity and its productions demand another organ than that of the scientific intelligence.\n",
    "Moreover, what we enjoy in the beauty of art is precisely the freedom of its productive and plastic energy.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "aes_str_51 = \"\"\"\n",
    "In the origination, as in the contemplation, of its creations we appear to escape wholly from the fetters of rule and regularity. In the forms of art we seek for repose and animation in place of the austerity of the reign of law and the sombre self-concentration of thought; we would exchange the shadowland of the idea3 for cheerful vigorous reality. And lastly, the source of artistic creations is the free activity of fancy, which in her imagination is more free than nature’s self. Not only has art at command the whole wealth of natural forms in the brilliant variety of their appearance, but also the creative imagination has power to expatiate inexhaustibly beyond their limit in products of its own. It may be supposed that, in presence of this immeasurable abundance of inspiration and its free creations, thought will necessarily lose the courage to bring them completely before it, to criticize them, and to array them under its universal formulae.\n",
    "\n",
    "[VIII]\n",
    "\n",
    "Science, on the contrary, everyone admits, is compelled by its form to busy itself with thought which abstracts from the mass of particulars. For this reason, on the one hand, imagination with its contingency and caprice – that is, the organ of artistic activity and enjoyment – is of necessity excluded from science. And on the other hand, seeing that art is what cheers and animates the dull and withered dryness of the idea,1 reconciles with reality its abstraction and its dissociation therefrom, and supplies out of the real world what is lacking to the notion, it follows, we may think, that a purely intellectual treatment of art destroys this very means of supplementation, annihilates it, and reduces the idea once more to its simplicity devoid of reality, and to its shadowy abstractness. And further, it is objected that science, as a matter of content, occupies itself with what is necessary. Now, if Aesthetic puts aside the beauty of nature, we not only gain nothing in respect of necessity, but to all appearance have got further away from it. For the expression Nature at once gives us the idea of Necessity and Uniformity,2 that is to say, of a behaviour which may be hoped to be akin to science, and capable of submitting thereto. But in the mind, generally, and more particularly in the imagination, compared with nature, caprice and lawlessness are supposed to be peculiarly at home; and these withdraw themselves as a matter of course from all scientific explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus in all these aspects – in origin, in effect, and in range – fine art, instead of showing itself fitted for scientific study, seems rather in its own right to resist the regulating activity of thought, and to be unsuitable for strict scientific discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "[IX]\n",
    "\n",
    "These and similar objections against a genuinely scientific treatment of fine art are drawn from common ideas, points of view, and considerations, which may be read ad nauseam in full elaboration in the older writers upon beauty and the fine arts, especially in the works of French authors.1 And in part they contain facts which have a certain truth; in part, too, the argumentation2 based upon these facts appears plausible at first sight. Thus, e.g., there is the fact that the forms of beauty are as manifold as the phenomenon of beauty is omnipresent; and from this, if we choose, we may proceed to conclude to a universal impulse of Beauty in human nature, and then go on to the further inference: that because ideas of beauty are so endlessly various, and therefore, as seems obvious, are something particular,3 it follows that there can be no universal laws of beauty and of taste.4\n",
    "\n",
    "[X]\n",
    "\n",
    "Before it is possible for us to turn from such considerations to our subject proper, it is our business to devote a brief introductory discussion to the objections and doubts which have been raised. In the first place, as regards the worthiness of art to be scientifically considered, it is no doubt the case that art can be employed as a fleeting pastime, to serve the ends of pleasure and entertainment, to decorate our surroundings, to impart pleasantness to the external conditions of our life, and to emphasize other objects by means of ornament. In this mode of employment art is indeed not independent, not free, but servile. But what we mean to consider, is the art which is free1 in its end as in its means.\n",
    "\n",
    "[XI]\n",
    "\n",
    "That art is in the abstract capable of serving other aims, and of being a mere pastime, is moreover a relation which it shares with thought. For, on the one hand, science, in the shape of the subservient understanding, submits to be used for finite purposes, and as an accidental means, and in that case is not self-determined, but determined by alien objects and relations; but, on the other hand, science liberates itself from this service to rise in free independence to the attainment of truth, in which medium, free from all interference, it fulfils itself in conformity with its proper aims.\n",
    "\n",
    "[XII]\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine art is not real art till it is in this sense free, and only achieves its highest task when it has taken its place in the same sphere with religion and philosophy, and has become simply a mode of revealing to consciousness and bringing to utterance the Divine Nature,1 the deepest interests of humanity, and the most comprehensive truths of the mind.2 It is in works of art that nations have deposited the profoundest intuitions and ideas of their hearts; and fine art is frequently the key – with many nations there is no other – to the understanding of their wisdom and of their religion.3\n",
    "\n",
    "[XIII]\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an attribute which art shares with religion and philosophy, only in this peculiar mode, that it represents even the highest ideas in sensuous forms,1 thereby bringing them nearer to the character of natural phenomena, to the senses, and to feeling. The world, into whose depths thought penetrates, is a supra-sensuous world, which is thus, to begin with, erected as a beyond over against immediate consciousness and present sensation; the power which thus rescues itself from the here, that consists in the actuality and finiteness of sense, is the freedom of thought in cognition. But the mind is able to heal this schism which its advance creates; it generates out of itself the works of fine art as the first middle term of reconciliation between pure thought and what is external, sensuous, and transitory, between nature with its finite actuality and the infinite freedom of the reason that comprehends.2\n",
    "\n",
    "[XIV]\n",
    "\n",
    "δ. The element of art was said to be in its general nature an unworthy element, as consisting in appearance and deception. The censure would be not devoid of justice, if it were possible to class appearance as something that ought not to exist. An appearance or show, however, is essential to existence. Truth could not be, did it not appear and reveal itself, were it not truth for someone or something, for itself as also for Mind.1 Therefore there can be no objection against appearance in general, but, if at all, against the particular mode of appearance in which art gives actuality to what is in itself real and true. If, in this aspect, the appearance with which art gives its conceptions life as determinate existences is to be termed a deception, this is a criticism which primarily receives its meaning by comparison with the external world of phenomena and its immediate contact with us as matter, and in like manner by the standard of our own world of feeling, that is, the inner world of sense. These are the two worlds to which, in the life of daily experience, in our own phenomenal2 life, we are accustomed to attribute the value and the title of actuality, reality, and truth, in contrast to art, which we set down as lacking such reality and truth. Now, this whole sphere of the empirical inner and outer world is just what is not the world of genuine reality, but is to be entitled a mere appearance more strictly than is true of art, and a crueller deception. Genuine reality is only to be found beyond the immediacy of feeling and of external objects.3 Nothing is genuinely real but that which is actual in its own right, that which is the substance of nature and of mind, fixing itself indeed in present and definite existence, but in this existence still retaining its essential and self-centred being, and thus and no otherwise attaining genuine reality. The dominion of these universal powers4 is exactly what art accentuates and reveals. The common outer and inner world also no doubt present to us this essence of reality, but in the shape of a chaos of accidental matters, encumbered by the immediateness of sensuous presentation, and by arbitrary states, events, characters, etc. Art liberates the real import of appearances from the semblance and deception of this bad and fleeting world, and imparts to phenomenal semblances a higher reality, born of mind. The appearances of art, therefore, far from being mere semblances, have the higher reality and the more genuine existence in comparison with the realities of common life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as little can the representations of art be called a deceptive semblance in comparison with the representations of historical narrative, as if that had the more genuine truth. For history has not even immediate existence, but only the intellectual presentation of it, for the element of its portrayals, and its content remains burdened with the whole mass of contingent matter formed by common reality with its occurrences, complications, and individualities. But the work of art brings before us the eternal powers that hold dominion in history, without any such superfluity in the way of immediate sensuous presentation and its unstable semblances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the mode of appearance of the shapes produced by art may be called a deception in comparison with philosophic thought, with religious or moral principles. Beyond a doubt the mode of revelation which a content attains in the realm of thought is the truest reality;1 but in comparison with the show or semblance of immediate sensuous existence or of historical narrative, the artistic semblance has the advantage that in itself it points beyond itself, and refers us away from itself to something spiritual which it is meant to bring before the mind’s eye. Whereas immediate appearance does not give itself out to be deceptive, but rather to be real and true, though all the time its truth is contaminated and infected by the immediate sensuous element. The hard rind of nature and the common world gives the mind more trouble in breaking through to the idea2 than do the products of art.\n",
    "\n",
    "[XVI]\n",
    "\n",
    "But if, on the one side, we assign this high position to art, we must no less bear in mind, on the other hand, that art is not, either in content or in form, the supreme and absolute mode of bringing the mind’s genuine interests into consciousness. The form of art is enough to limit it to a restricted content. Only a certain circle and grade of truth is capable of being represented in the medium of art.1 Such truth must have in its own nature the capacity to go forth into sensuous form and be adequate to itself therein, if it is to be a genuinely artistic content, as is the case with the gods of Greece.2 There is, however, a deeper form of truth, in which it is no longer so closely akin and so friendly to sense as to be adequately embraced and expressed by that medium. Of such a kind is the Christian conception of truth; and more especially the spirit of our modern world, or, to come closer, of our religion and our intellectual culture, reveals itself as beyond the stage at which art is the highest mode assumed by man’s consciousness of the absolute.3 The peculiar mode to which artistic production and works of art belong no longer satisfies our supreme need. We are above the level at which works of art can be venerated as divine, and actually worshipped; the impression which they make is of a more considerate kind, and the feelings which they stir within us require a higher test and a further confirmation. Thought and reflection have taken their flight above fine art.4 Those who delight in grumbling and censure may set down this phenomenon for a corruption, and ascribe it to the predominance of passion and selfish interests, which scare away at once the seriousness and the cheerfulness of art. Or we may accuse the troubles of the present time and the complicated condition of civil and political life as hindering the feelings, entangled in minute preoccupations, from freeing themselves, and rising to the higher aims of art, the intelligence itself being subordinate to petty needs and interests, in sciences which only subserve such purposes and are seduced into making this barren region their home.\n",
    "\n",
    "[XVII]\n",
    "\n",
    "However all this may be, it certainly is the case that art no longer affords that satisfaction of spiritual wants which earlier epochs and peoples have sought therein, and have found therein only; a satisfaction which, at all events on the religious side, was most intimately and profoundly connected with art.1 The beautiful days of Greek art, and the golden time of the later middle ages are gone by.2 The reflective culture of our life of today, makes it a necessity for us, in respect of our will no less than of our judgement, to adhere to general points of view, and to regulate particular matters according to them, so that general forms, laws, duties, rights, maxims are what have validity as grounds of determination and are the chief regulative force. But what is required for artistic interest as for artistic production is, speaking generally, a living creation, in which the universal is not present as law and maxim, but acts as if one with the mood and the feelings, just as, in the imagination, the universal and rational is contained only as brought into unity with a concrete sensuous phenomenon. Therefore, our present in its universal condition is not favourable to art.3 As regards the artist himself, it is not merely that the reflection which finds utterance all round him, and the universal habit of having an opinion and passing judgement about art infect him, and mislead him into putting more abstract thought into his works themselves;4 but also the whole spiritual culture of the age is of such a kind that he himself stands within this reflective world and its conditions, and it is impossible for him to abstract from it by will and resolve, or to contrive for himself and bring to pass, by means of peculiar education or removal from the relations of life, a peculiar solitude that would replace all that is lost.5\n",
    "\n",
    "[XVIII]\n",
    "\n",
    "In all these respects art is, and remains for us, on the side of its highest destiny, a thing of the past.1 Herein it has further lost for us its genuine truth and life, and rather is transferred into our ideas2 than asserts its former necessity, or assumes its former place, in reality. What is now aroused in us by works of art is over and above our immediate enjoyment, and together with it, our judgement; inasmuch as we subject the content and the means of representation of the work of art and the suitability or unsuitability of the two to our intellectual consideration.3 Therefore, the science of art is a much more pressing need in our day than in times in which art, simply as art, was enough to furnish a full satisfaction. Art invites us to consideration of it by means of thought, not to the end of stimulating art production, but in order to ascertain scientifically what art is.\n",
    "\n",
    "ε. As soon as we propose to accept this invitation we are met by the difficulty which has already been touched upon in the suggestion that, though art is a suitable subject for philosophical reflection in the general sense, yet it is not so for systematic and scientific discussion. In this objection there lies the false idea that a philosophical consideration may, nevertheless, be unscientific. On this point it can only be remarked here with brevity that, whatever ideas others may have of philosophy and philosophizing, I regard the pursuit of philosophy as utterly incapable of existing apart from a scientific procedure. Philosophy has to consider its object in its necessity, not, indeed, in its subjective necessity or external arrangement, classification, etc., but it has to unfold and demonstrate the object out of the necessity of its own inner nature.1 Until this evolution2 is brought to pass the scientific element is lacking to the treatment. In as far, however, as the objective necessity of an object lies essentially in its logical and metaphysical nature, the isolated treatment of art must be conducted with a certain relaxation of scientific stringency. For art involves the most complex presuppositions, partly in reference to its content, partly in respect of its medium and element,3 in which art is constantly on the borders of the arbitrary or accidental. Thus it is only as regards the essential innermost progress of its content and of its media of expression4 that we must call to mind the outline prescribed by its necessity.\n",

    "The objection that works of fine art elude the treatment of scientific thought because they originate out of the unregulated fancy and out of the feelings, are of a number and variety that defy the attempt to gain a conspectus, and therefore take effect only on feeling and imagination, raises a problem which appears still to have importance. For the beauty of art does in fact appear in a form which is expressly contrasted with abstract thought, and which the latter is forced to destroy1 in exerting the activity which is its nature. This idea coheres with the opinion that reality as such, the life of nature and of mind, is disfigured and slain by comprehension; that, so far from being brought close to us by the thought which comprehends, it is by it that such life is absolutely dissociated from us, so that, by the use of thought as the means of grasping what has life, man rather cuts himself off from this his purpose. We cannot speak fully on this subject in the present passage, but only indicate the point of view from which the removal of this difficulty, or impossibility depending on maladaptation, might be effected.2\n",

    "It will be admitted, to begin with, that the mind is capable of contemplating itself, and of possessing a consciousness, and that a thinking consciousness, of itself and all that is generated by itself. Thought – to think – is precisely that in which the mind has its innermost and essential nature. In gaining this thinking consciousness concerning itself and its products, the mind is behaving according to its essential nature, however much freedom and caprice those products may display, supposing only that in real truth they have mind in them. Now art and its works as generated and created by the mind (spirit) are themselves of a spiritual nature, even if their mode of representation admits into itself the semblance of sensuous being, and pervades what is sensuous with mind. In this respect art is, to begin with, nearer to mind and its thinking activity than is mere external unintelligent nature; in works of art, mind has to do but with its own.1 And even if artistic works are not abstract thought and notion,2 but are an evolution of the notion out of itself, an alienation3 from itself towards the sensuous, still the power of the thinking spirit (mind) lies herein, not merely to grasp itself only in its peculiar form of the self-conscious spirit (mind), but just as much to recognize itself in its alienation4 in the shape of feeling and the sensuous, in its other form, by transmuting the metamorphosed thought5 back into definite thoughts, and so restoring it to itself. And in this preoccupation with the other of itself the thinking spirit is not to be held untrue to itself as if forgetting or surrendering itself therein, nor is it so weak as to lack strength to comprehend what is different from itself, but it comprehends both itself and its opposite. For the notion is the universal, which preserves itself in its particularizations, dominates alike itself and its ‘other’, and so becomes the power and activity that consists in undoing the alienation6 which it had evolved.7 And thus the work of art in which thought alienates itself8 belongs, like thought itself, to the realm of comprehending thought, and the mind, in subjecting it to scientific consideration, is thereby but satisfying the want of its own inmost nature. For because thought is its essence and notion, it can in the last resort only be satisfied when it has succeeded in imbuing all the products of its activity with thought, and has thus for the first time made them genuinely its own. But, as we shall see more definitely below, art is far from being the highest form of mind, and receives its true ratification only from science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as little does art elude philosophical consideration by unbridled caprice. As has already been indicated, it is its true task to bring to consciousness1 the highest interests of the mind. Hence it follows at once with respect to the content2 that fine art cannot rove in the wildness of unfettered fancy, for these spiritual interests determine definite bases3 for its content, how manifold and inexhaustible soever its forms and shapes may be. The same holds true for the forms themselves. They, again, are not at the mercy of mere chance. Not every plastic shape4 is capable of being the expression and representation of those spiritual interests, of absorbing and of reproducing them; every definite content determines a form suitable to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this aspect too, then, we are in a position to find our bearings according to the needs of thought in the apparently unmanageable mass of works and types of art.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I hope, we have begun by defining the content of our science, to which we propose to confine ourselves, and have seen that neither is fine art unworthy of a philosophical consideration, nor is a philosophical consideration incompetent to arrive at a knowledge of the essence of fine art.\n",
