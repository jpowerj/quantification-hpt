    Hugely influential study of the psychology of authoritarianismWhat makes a
  fascist? Are there character traits that make someone more likely to vote for
  the far right? The Authoritarian Personality is not only one of the most
  significant works of social psychology ever written, it also marks a
  milestone in the development of Adorno's thought, showing him grappling with
  the problem of fascism and the reasons for Europe's turn to reaction. Over
  half a century later and with the rise of right-wing populism and the
  reemergence of the far-right in recent years, this hugely influential study
  remains as insightful and relevant as ever. This new edition includes an
  introduction by Frankfurt School scholar Peter E. Gordon and contains the
  first-ever publication of Adorno's subsequent critical notes on the project.%

    This is the work in which Louis Althusser formulated some of his most
  influential ideas.~For Marx, first published in France in 1968, has come to
  be regarded as the founding text of the school of "structuralist Marxism"
  which was presided over by the fascinating and enigmatic figure of Louis
  Althusser. Structuralism constituted an intellectual revolution in the 1960s
  and 1970s and radically transformed the way philosophy, political and social
  theory, history, science, and aesthetics were discussed and thought about.
  For Marx was a key contribution to that process and it fundamentally recast
  the way in which many people understood Marx and Marxism.This book contains
  the classic statements of Althusser's analysis of the young Marx and the
  importance of Feuerbach during this formative period, of his thesis of the
  "epistomological break" between the early and the late Marx, and of his
  conception of dialectics, contradiction and "overdetermination." Also
  included is a study of the materialist theater of Bertolazzi and Brecht and
  the critique of humanist readings of Marxism. Since his death in 1990,
  Althusser's legacy has come under renewed examination and it is increasingly
  recognized that the influence of his ideas has been wider and deeper than
  previously thought: reading For Marx, in its audacity, originality and rigor,
  will explain why this impact was so significant.%

    The Origins of Totalitarianism is an indispensable book for understanding
  the frightful barbarity of the twentieth century. Suspicious of the
  inevitability so often imposed by hindsight, Hannah Arendt was not interested
  in detailing the causes that produced totalitarianism. Nothing in the
  nineteenth century--indeed, nothing in human history--could have prepared us
  for the idea of political domination achieved by organizing the infinite
  plurality and differentiation of human beings as if all humanity were just
  one individual. Arendt believed that such a development marked a grotesque
  departure from all that had come before. In The Origins of Totalitarianism,
  Arendt sought to provide an historical account of the forces that
  crystallized into totalitarianism: The ebb and flow of nineteenth-century
  anti-Semitism (she deemed the Dreyfus Affair a dress rehearsal for the Final
  Solution) and he rise of European imperialism, accompanied by the invention
  of racism as the only possible rationalization for it. For Arendt,
  totalitarianism was a form of governance that eliminated the very possibility
  of political action. Totalitarian leaders attract both mobs and elites, take
  advantage of the unthinkability of their atrocities, target "objective
  enemies" (classes of people who are liquidated simply because of their group
  membership), use terror to create loyalty, rely on concentration camps, and
  are obsessive in their pursuit of global primacy. But even more presciently,
  Arendt understood that totalitarian solutions could well survive the demise
  of totalitarian regimes. The Origins of Totalitarianism remains as essential
  a book for understanding our times as it was when it first appeared more than
  fifty years ago.%

    This paper provides a quantitative analysis of the effects of the law and
  economics movement on the U.S. justice system using the universe of opinions
  in U.S. Circuit Courts from 1891 and 1 million District Court criminal
  sentencing decisions linked to judge identity. We use attendance in a
  controversial economics training program that 40\% of federal judges attended
  by 1990, a policy change giving judges more sentencing discretion, random
  assignment of judges to control for court- and case-level factors, an
  exogenous seating network from random panel composition to trace the spread
  of economic reasoning in law, and ordering of cases within Circuit to
  identify memetic economic ideas that move across legal topics. We find that
  judges who use law and economics language vote for and author conservative
  verdicts in economics cases and are more opposed to government regulation and
  criminal appeals. After attending Henry Manne's economics training program,
  judges use more economics language and render conservative verdicts in
  economics cases and reject criminal appeals, and this result is robust to a
  large set of judge biographical controls. Manne economics training is more
  predictive of these decisions than political party. Manne judges render 20\%
  harsher (10 months longer) criminal sentences after U.S. v. Booker allowed
  more sentencing discretion. They also impact criminal appeals verdicts when
  not authoring the opinion. Judges exposed to Manne peers increase their use
  of economics language in subsequent opinions. Ideas such as ``optimal
  deterrence'', ``capital'', and ``law and economics'' move across legal
  topics.%

    This volume guides the reader through a detailed examination of the text to
  an understanding of Locke's political ideas in relation to his writings on
  philosophy, education, religion and economics and the influence these ideas
  had upon eighteenth-century political theorists. The author shows how Locke
  carefully constructed his political perspective as a defence of the
  principles of natural rights, constitutional government and popular
  resistance. He offers an original interpretation of the Two Treatises...,
  emphasizing the specific ways in which Locke's political purposes in writing
  the work influence his discussion of such concepts as the state of nature,
  property, consent and tyranny. The author discusses the historical and
  biographical context of the work and demonstrates how eighteenth century
  political thinkers developed or rejected aspects of Locke's political theory
  and summarizes important recent studies of Locke's work.%

    John L. Austin was one of the leading philosophers of the twentieth
  century. The William James Lectures presented Austin's conclusions in the
  field to which he directed his main efforts on a wide variety of
  philosophical problems. These talks became the classic How to Do Things with
  Words . For this second edition, the editors have returned to Austin's
  original lecture notes, amending the printed text where it seemed necessary.
  Students will find the new text clearer, and, at the same time, more faithful
  to the actual lectures. An appendix contains literal transcriptions of a
  number of marginal notes made by Austin but not included in the text.
  Comparison of the text with these annotations provides new dimensions to the
  study of Austin's work.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The French Revolution brought principles of ``liberty, equality,
  fraternity'' to bear on the day-to-day challenges of governing what was then
  the largest country in Europe. Its experiments provided a model for future
  revolutions and democracies across the globe, but this first modern
  revolution had no model to follow. Using reconstructed transcripts of debates
  held in the Revolution's first parliament, we present a quantitative analysis
  of how this body managed innovation. We use information theory to track the
  creation, transmission, and destruction of word-use patterns across over
  40,000 speeches and a thousand speakers. The parliament as a whole was biased
  toward the adoption of new patterns, but speakers' individual qualities could
  break these overall trends. Speakers on the left innovated at higher rates,
  while speakers on the right acted to preserve prior patterns. Key players
  such as Robespierre (on the left) and Abb\'e Maury (on the right) played
  information-processing roles emblematic of their politics. Newly created
  organizational functions\textemdash such as the Assembly president and
  committee chairs\textemdash had significant effects on debate outcomes, and a
  distinct transition appears midway through the parliament when committees,
  external to the debate process, gained new powers to ``propose and dispose.''
  Taken together, these quantitative results align with existing qualitative
  interpretations, but also reveal crucial information-processing dynamics that
  have hitherto been overlooked. Great orators had the public's attention, but
  deputies (mostly on the political left) who mastered the committee system
  gained new powers to shape revolutionary legislation.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their
  self-attention operation, which scales quadratically with the sequence
  length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an
  attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy
  to process documents of thousands of tokens or longer. Longformer's attention
  mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and
  combines a local windowed attention with a task motivated global attention.
  Following prior work on long-sequence transformers, we evaluate Longformer on
  character-level language modeling and achieve state-of-the-art results on
  text8 and enwik8. In contrast to most prior work, we also pretrain Longformer
  and finetune it on a variety of downstream tasks. Our pretrained Longformer
  consistently outperforms RoBERTa on long document tasks and sets new
  state-of-the-art results on WikiHop and TriviaQA. We finally introduce the
  Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED), a Longformer variant for supporting long
  document generative sequence-to-sequence tasks, and demonstrate its
  effectiveness on the arXiv summarization dataset.%

    A justification is offered for approaching classic works of political
  theory as relevant to problems that concern us. Perennial problems are shown
  to exist in three increasingly controversial senses. First, past authors
  addressed a problem which we can ponder. Second, past authors addressed a
  problem which authors who wrote on these authors also addressed and which we
  can ponder. Third, numerous authors expressed beliefs relevant to a problem
  which we can ponder. The errors identified by opponents of perennial problems
  arise from empirical misjudgements concerning the ways that different authors
  addressed such problems, not from the assumption that such problems exist.%

    Recent work has found evidence that Multilingual BERT (mBERT), a
  transformer-based multilingual masked language model, is capable of zero-shot
  cross-lingual transfer, suggesting that some aspects of its representations
  are shared cross-lingually. To better understand this overlap, we extend
  recent work on finding syntactic trees in neural networks' internal
  representations to the multilingual setting. We show that subspaces of mBERT
  representations recover syntactic tree distances in languages other than
  English, and that these subspaces are approximately shared across languages.
  Motivated by these results, we present an unsupervised analysis method that
  provides evidence mBERT learns representations of syntactic dependency
  labels, in the form of clusters which largely agree with the Universal
  Dependencies taxonomy. This evidence suggests that even without explicit
  supervision, multilingual masked language models learn certain linguistic
  universals.%

  traditional historical materialism, in the light of which he reconstructs the
  theory, and he studies the implications for historical materialism of the

    A general account of the languages of the Soviet Union, one of the most

  belonging to five main families and ranging from Russian, which is the first
  language of about 130,000,000 people, to Aluet, spoken only by 96 (in the
  1970 census). Dr Comrie has two general aims. First, he presents the most
  important structural features of these languages, their genetic relationships
  and classification and their distinctive typological features. Secondly, he
  examines the social and political background to the use of functioning of the
  various languages in a multilingual state. The volume will be of importance

  language of politics is not a neutral medium that conveys ideas independently

    We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands
  for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent
  language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep
  bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on
  both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT
  model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create
  state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering
  and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture
  modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It
  obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing
  tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute
  improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD
  v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and
  SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).%

    Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs) are matrices of the squared distances
  between points. The definition is deceivingly simple; thanks to their many
  useful properties, they have found applications in psychometrics,
  crystallography, machine learning, wireless sensor networks, acoustics, and
  more. Despite the usefulness of EDMs, they seem to be insufficiently known in
  the signal processing community. Our goal is to rectify this mishap in a
  concise tutorial. We review the fundamental properties of EDMs, such as rank
  or (non)definiteness, and show how the various EDM properties can be used to
  design algorithms for completing and denoising distance data. Along the way,
  we demonstrate applications to microphone position calibration, ultrasound
  tomography, room reconstruction from echoes, and phase retrieval. By spelling
  out the essential algorithms, we hope to fast-track the readers in applying
  EDMs to their own problems. The code for all of the described algorithms and
  to generate the figures in the article is available online at
  http://lcav.epfl.ch/ivan.dokmanic. Finally, we suggest directions for further
  research.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    This book is the first complete commentary on Marx's manuscripts of
  1861-63, works that guide our understanding of fundamental concepts such as
  'surplus-value' and 'production price'. The recent publication of Marx's
  writings in their entirety has been a seminal event in Marxian scholarship.
  The hitherto unknown second draft of Volume 1 and first draft of Volume 3 of
  Capital, both published in the Manuscripts of 1861-63, now provide an
  important intermediate link between the Grundrisse and the final published
  editions of Capital. In this book, Enrique Dussel, one of the most original
  Marxist philosophers in the world today, provides an authoritative and
  detailed commentary on the manuscripts of 1861-63. The main points which
  Dussel emphasises in this path-breaking work are: The fundamental category in
  Marx's theory is 'living labour' which exists outside of capital and which
  capital must subsume in order to produce surplus-value Theories of Surplus
  Value is not a historical survey of previous theories, but rather a 'critical
  confrontation' through which Marx developed new categories for his own theory
  The most important new categories developed in this manuscript are related to
  the 'forms of appearance' of surplus value. The final part of the book
  discusses the relevance of the Manuscripts of 1861-63 to contemporary global
  capitalism, especially to the continuing underdevelopment and extreme poverty
  of Latin America.%

    While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence
  embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT
  based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored. We
  systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence
  embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and
  cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM),
  translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and
  additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual
  language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data
  required to achieve good performance by 80\%. Composing the best of these
  methods produces a model that achieves 83.7\% bi-text retrieval accuracy over
  112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5\% achieved by LASER, while
  still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks.
  Parallel data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train
  competitive NMT models for en-zh and en-de. We publicly release our best
  multilingual sentence embedding model for 109+ languages at
  https://tfhub.dev/google/LaBSE.%

    While generative models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have
  proven fruitful in topic modeling, they often require detailed assumptions
  and careful specification of hyperparameters. Such model complexity issues
  only compound when trying to generalize generative models to incorporate
  human input. We introduce Correlation Explanation (CorEx), an alternative
  approach to topic modeling that does not assume an underlying generative
  model, and instead learns maximally informative topics through an
  information-theoretic framework. This framework naturally generalizes to
  hierarchical and semi-supervised extensions with no additional modeling
  assumptions. In particular, word-level domain knowledge can be flexibly
  incorporated within CorEx through anchor words, allowing topic separability
  and representation to be promoted with minimal human intervention. Across a
  variety of datasets, metrics, and experiments, we demonstrate that CorEx
  produces topics that are comparable in quality to those produced by
  unsupervised and semi-supervised variants of LDA.%

    In this book Marx's observations on history, which are found scattered

  assessment of Marx\&\#39;s views on all the epochs that cross his historical
  vision. Gandy treats Marx\&\#39;s ideas on primitive societies, on ancient
  Roman and Asiatic civilization, on the structure of feudalism, on strategies
  for overthrowing capitalism, and on the hypothetical communist future. Among
  the author\&\#39;s departures from traditional readings of Marx are his
  interpretations of class struggle, his conception of social strata, and his
  cogent analysis of the \&quot;new Marxism.\&quot; Since many aspects of
  Marxist historical theory have been neglected or distorted, Gandy\&\#39;s
  remarkably clear commentary, based on extensive research\textemdash including
  an exhaustive study of the forty-volume Marx-Engels Werke\textemdash will
  doubtless stimulate debate among sociologists and other students of social

    Assessing scholarly influence is critical for understanding the collective
  system of scholarship and the history of academic inquiry. Influence is
  multifaceted, and citations reveal only part of it. Citation counts exhibit
  preferential attachment and follow a rigid ``news cycle'' that can miss
  sustained and indirect forms of influence. Building on dynamic topic models
  that track distributional shifts in discourse over time, we introduce a
  variant that incorporates features, such as authorship, affiliation, and
  publication venue, to assess how these contexts interact with content to
  shape future scholarship. We perform in-depth analyses on collections of
  physics research (500,000 abstracts; 102 years) and scholarship generally
  (JSTOR repository: 2 million full-text articles; 130 years). Our measure of
  document influence helps predict citations and shows how outcomes, such as
  winning a Nobel Prize or affiliation with a highly ranked institution, boost
  influence. Analysis of citations alongside discursive influence reveals that
  citations tend to credit authors who persist in their fields over time and
  discount credit for works that are influential over many topics or are
  ``ahead of their time.'' In this way, our measures provide a way to
  acknowledge diverse contributions that take longer and travel farther to
  achieve scholarly appreciation, enabling us to correct citation biases and
  enhance sensitivity to the full spectrum of scholarly impact.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In this new and brilliantly organized book of essays, Anthony Giddens
  discusses three main theoretical traditions in social science that cut across
  the division between Marxist and non-Marxist sociology: interpretive
  sociology, functionalism, and structuralism.Beginning with a critical
  examination of the importance of structuralism for contemporary sociology,
  the author develops a comprehensive account of what he calls "the theory of
  structuration." One of the main themes is that social theory must recognize,
  as it has not done hitherto, that all social actors are knowledgeable about
  the social systems they produce and reproduce in their conduct. In order to
  grasp the significance of this, he argues, we have to reconsider some of the
  most basic concepts in sociology.In particular, Giddens argues, it is
  essential to recognize the significance of time-space relations in social
  theory. He rejects the distinction between synchrony and diachrony, or
  statics and dynamics, involved in both structuralism and functionalism, and
  offers extensive critical commentary on the latter as an approach to
  sociology.The book, which can be described as a "non-functionalist
  manifesto," breaks with the three main theoretical traditions in the social
  sciences today while retaining the significant contributions each contains.
  In so doing Giddens discusses a range of fundamental problem areas in the
  social sciences: power and domination, conflict and contradiction, and social
  transformation. He concludes with an overall appraisal of the key problems in
  social theory today.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In the first major reinterpretation of the French Enlightenment in twenty
  years, Dena Goodman moves beyond the traditional approach to the
  Enlightenment as a chapter in Western intellectual history and examines its
  deeper significance as cultural history. She finds the very epicenter of the
  Enlightenment in a community of discourse known as the Republic of Letters,
  where salons governed by women advanced the Enlightenment project "to change
  the common way of thinking." Goodman details the history of the Republic of
  Letters in the Parisian salons, where men and women, philosophes and
  salonnieres, together not only introduced reciprocity into intellectual life
  through the practices of letter writing and polite conversation but also
  developed a republican model of government that was to challenge the
  monarchy. Providing a new understanding of women's importance in the
  Enlightenment, Goodman demonstrates that in the Republic of Letters men and
  women played complementary - and unequal - roles. Salonnieres governed the
  Republic of Letters by enforcing rules of polite conversation that made
  possible a discourse characterized by liberty and civility. Goodman
  chronicles the story of the Republic of Letters from its earliest formation
  through major periods of change: the production of the Encyclopedia, the
  proliferation of a print culture that widened circles of readership beyond
  the control of salon governance, and the early years of the French
  Revolution. Although the legacy of the Republic of Letters remained a force
  in French cultural and political life, in the 1780s men formed new
  intellectual institutions that asserted their ability to govern themselves
  and that marginalized women. TheRepublic of Letters introduces provocative
  explanations both for the failure of the Enlightenment and for the role of
  the Enlightenment in the French Revolution.%

    This book reconstructs how a group of nineteenth-century labor reformers
  appropriated and radicalized the republican tradition. These "labor
  republicans" derived their definition of freedom from a long tradition of
  political theory dating back to the classical republics. In this tradition,
  to be free is to be independent of anyone else's will - to be dependent is to
  be a slave. Borrowing these ideas, labor republicans argued that wage
  laborers were unfree because of their abject dependence on their employers.
  Workers in a cooperative, on the other hand, were considered free because
  they equally and collectively controlled their work. Although these labor
  republicans are relatively unknown, this book details their unique,
  contemporary, and valuable perspective on both American history and the
  organization of the economy.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Scaling multilingual representation learning beyond the hundred most
  frequent languages is challenging, in particular to cover the long tail of
  low-resource languages. A promising approach has been to train one-for-all
  multilingual models capable of cross-lingual transfer, but these models often
  suffer from insufficient capacity and interference between unrelated
  languages. Instead, we move away from this approach and focus on training
  multiple language (family) specific representations, but most prominently
  enable all languages to still be encoded in the same representational space.
  To achieve this, we focus on teacher-student training, allowing all encoders
  to be mutually compatible for bitext mining, and enabling fast learning of
  new languages. We introduce a new teacher-student training scheme which
  combines supervised and self-supervised training, allowing encoders to take
  advantage of monolingual training data, which is valuable in the low-resource
  setting. Our approach significantly outperforms the original LASER encoder.
  We study very low-resource languages and handle 50 African languages, many of
  which are not covered by any other model. For these languages, we train
  sentence encoders, mine bitexts, and validate the bitexts by training NMT
  systems.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Three years after Stalin's death, Khrushchev shocked the world by revealing
  much of the truth about the crimes of Stalin. Most affected by the
  revelations were the Communist Parties, who had held Stalin in god-like
  reverence. This thesis examines the effects, both of these revelations on the
  British Communist Party, and of the second cataclysmic event of that year -
  the Hungarian Uprising and its suppression by Soviet tanks. It appears that
  to many members, an opportunity was presented by Khrushchev's frankness, to
  renew the Communist movement and set aside the old dogmatic ways; this desire
  for real change did not, unfortunately, permeate the ranks of the British
  Party leadership. At all points, whilst allowing open debate to proceed, the
  leadership took positions and expressed views designed to consolidate and
  continue in the old mould. Demands for a rigorous analysis of the Stalinist
  period, including the role of the system of democratic centralism, were never
  fully taken up; the British Party leadership persisted in taking the
  Khrushchev line - that Stalin, and the cult of the personality, were
  responsible for the abuses. The questioning of basic Communist principles,
  such as democratic centralism was not permitted. Considerable debate did take
  place, however, within the Party press and in the unofficial journal 'The
  Reasoner', on many topics including Inner-Party Democracy, the rewriting of
  'The British Road to Socialism', anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union and unrest
  in Eastern Europe. The leadership eventually responded to demands for a
  Special Congress in recognition of the cataclysmic nature of the events. The
  British Party leadership sought primarily to defend what it knew best - the
  structures of the Party, and its unthinking loyalty to the Soviet Union. This
  latter feature proved a heavy strain on the Party when the leadership
  unconditionally supported the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Uprising.
  The combined effect of the events of 1956 led to a membership loss in the
  region of 7,000. 1956 appears to have been a tragically wasted opportunity
  for the international Communist movement. Having exposed and rejected the
  distortions of the Stalin period, the possibilities were not taken up. The
  man had gone, but the system remained unaltered. This thesis attempts to
  show, however, that whilst the British Party had been nominally independent
  since the dissolution of the Comintern in 1943, it was, because of its
  historical development, psychologically subordinate to Moscow. For the
  leaders of the British Communist Party to have gone against the Soviet line,
  no matter how appalling their decisions, no matter now reasonable the
  arguments of the British Party dissidents, would have been inconceivable. For
  many British Communists, Marxism-Leninism had become an article of faith,
  rather than a political philosophy and practical tool; for many others
  however, the events of 1956 demonstrated that faith and reason could no
  longer be reconciled. Despite the departure of many, this dichotomy was to
  remain within the British Communist Party, along with the structures of
  democratic centralism, until its dissolution in November 1991.%

    A 2015 James Beard Award Finalist: "Eye-opening, insightful, and huge fun
  to read." \textemdash Bee Wilson, author of Consider the Fork Why do we eat
  toast for breakfast, and then toast to good health at dinner? What does the
  turkey we eat on Thanksgiving have to do with the country on the eastern
  Mediterranean? Can you figure out how much your dinner will cost by counting
  the words on the menu? In The Language of Food, Stanford University professor
  and MacArthur Fellow Dan Jurafsky peels away the mysteries from the foods we
  think we know. Thirteen chapters evoke the joy and discovery of reading a
  menu dotted with the sharp-eyed annotations of a linguist. Jurafsky points
  out the subtle meanings hidden in filler words like "rich" and "crispy,"
  zeroes in on the metaphors and storytelling tropes we rely on in restaurant
  reviews, and charts a microuniverse of marketing language on the back of a
  bag of potato chips. The fascinating journey through The Language of Food
  uncovers a global atlas of culinary influences. With Jurafsky's insight,
  words like ketchup, macaron, and even salad become living fossils that
  contain the patterns of early global exploration that predate our modern
  fusion-filled world. From ancient recipes preserved in Sumerian song lyrics
  to colonial shipping routes that first connected East and West, Jurafsky
  paints a vibrant portrait of how our foods developed. A surprising history of
  culinary exchange\textemdash a sharing of ideas and culture as much as
  ingredients and flavors\textemdash lies just beneath the surface of our daily
  snacks, soups, and suppers. Engaging and informed, Jurafsky's unique study
  illuminates an extraordinary network of language, history, and food. The menu
  is yours to enjoy.%

    We argue word embedding models are a useful tool for the study of culture
  using a historical analysis of shared understandings of social class as an
  empirical case. Word embeddings represent semantic relations between words as
  relationships between vectors in a high-dimensional space, specifying a
  relational model of meaning consistent with contemporary theories of culture.
  Dimensions induced by word differences (rich \textendash{} poor) in these
  spaces correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of
  words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we
  validate with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over
  100 years, we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the
  economic transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural
  dimensions of class remained remarkably stable. The notable exception is
  education, which became tightly linked to affluence independent of its
  association with cultivated taste.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    We propose a new computational approach for tracking and detecting
  statistically significant linguistic shifts in the meaning and usage of
  words. Such linguistic shifts are especially prevalent on the Internet, where
  the rapid exchange of ideas can quickly change a word's meaning. Our
  meta-analysis approach constructs property time series of word usage, and
  then uses statistically sound change point detection algorithms to identify
  significant linguistic shifts. We consider and analyze three approaches of
  increasing complexity to generate such linguistic property time series, the
  culmination of which uses distributional characteristics inferred from word
  co-occurrences. Using recently proposed deep neural language models, we first
  train vector representations of words for each time period. Second, we warp
  the vector spaces into one unified coordinate system. Finally, we construct a
  distance-based distributional time series for each word to track its
  linguistic displacement over time. We demonstrate that our approach is
  scalable by tracking linguistic change across years of micro-blogging using
  Twitter, a decade of product reviews using a corpus of movie reviews from
  Amazon, and a century of written books using the Google Book Ngrams. Our
  analysis reveals interesting patterns of language usage change commensurate
  with each medium.%

    Divergent Paths is the first volume of a groundbreaking three-volume work.
  Its purpose is to explore the relationship between Hegel and Marx; to define
  the relationship between Hegel and Engels; and to distinguish between the
  theories of Marxism and Engelsism. Marx used Feuerbach towards the critique
  and ultimate transformation of Hegel's phenomenology and humanism. This
  transformation, which cut out Hegel's idealism by identifying the environment
  in which people produced their sustenance as the subject of history, marks
  the genesis of historical materialism. Marx continued to use Hegel's logical
  categories. In chapter three of Divergent Paths, Norman Levine conducts an in
  depth study of Marx's 1841 doctoral dissertation, The Difference Between
  Democritus' and Epicurus' Philosophy of Nature. It is the center of gravity
  and controversy of Levine's study. Placed alongside Hegel's Philosophy of
  History, Levine isolates the categories Marx appropriated from Hegel to show,
  conclusively, that Marx was not a dialectical materialist. Levine then claims
  that Engels totally distorted the Hegelian legacy, and this debasement is
  enshrined in his 1887 essay 'Ludwig Feuerbach and The End of Classical German
  Philosophy.' Levine brilliantly locates Marxism as the theory of Marx, and
  Engelsism the theory of Engels. According to Levine both embodied a separate
  view of history and society, and their contradictions are expressive, in
  part, of their divergent receptions of Hegel. This is an analysis like no
  other published to date with two more volumes planned. Philosophers,
  sociologists, anthropologists and historiographers of Marx and Engels cannot
  afford to miss this study.%

    "This defining work will be valuable to readers and researchers in social
  sciences and humanities at all academic levels. As a teaching resource it
  will be useful to instructors and students alike and will become a standard

  collections."--CHOICEThis Encyclopedia provides readers with authoritative
  essays on virtually all social science methods topics, quantitative and
  qualitative, by an international collection of experts. Organized
  alphabetically, the Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods covers
  research terms ranging from different methodological approaches to
  epistemological issues and specific statistical techniques. Written to be
  accessible to general readers, the Encyclopedia entries do not require
  advanced knowledge of mathematics or statistics to understand the purposes or
  basic principles of any of the methods. To accomplish this goal, there are
  two major types of entries: definitions consisting of a paragraph or two to
  provide a quick explanation of a methodological term; and topical treatments
  or essays that discuss the nature, history, applications, and implications of
  using a certain method, including suggested readings and references. Readers
  are directed to related topics via cross-referenced terms that appear in
  small capital letters. By assembling entries of varied origins and serving
  different research purposes, readers will be able to benefit from this
  immense source of methodological expertise in advancing their understanding
  of research.With three volumes and more than 900 signed entries, the
  Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods will be a critical addition
  to any social science library.%

    Recent work on the history of political thought, exploiting digital

  to study ideas, to outline underlying paradigms relating language and
  politics in these respective fields, and to consider how they could be
  brought into productive conversation. I then consider how such conversation

    Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan
  builds your knowledge of and confidence in making inferences from data.
  Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book
  pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated.
  This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the
  details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling
  work. The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel
  models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory
  and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression
  to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing
  data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.
  The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to
  causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also
  contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered

    The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method
  for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a
  large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this
  paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the
  vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we
  obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations.
  We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called
  negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their
  indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic
  phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily
  combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a
  simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector
  representations for millions of phrases is possible.%

    John Pocock is arguably the most original and imaginative historian of
  ideas of modern times. Over the past half century he has created an audience
  for his work which is truly global, and he has marked the way in which the
  history of political thought is studied as deeply and personally as any
  historian of the period. The essays in this major new collection are selected
  from a lifetime of thinking about political thought, and how we should study
  it in history. What in fact does it mean to write the history of a political
  society, and what kind of political thought is this? Professor Pocock
  emphasises both the theory and practice of political thought considered as
  action in history, and the political theory of historiography considered as a
  form of political thought. Together these essays constitute a collection that
  any serious student of politics and intellectual history needs to possess.%

    Originally published in 1975, The Machiavellian Moment remains a landmark
  of historical and political thought. Celebrated historian J.G.A. Pocock looks
  at the consequences for modern historical and social consciousness arising
  from the ideal of the classical republic revived by Machiavelli and other
  thinkers of Renaissance Italy. Pocock shows that Machiavelli's prime emphasis
  was on the moment in which the republic confronts the problem of its own
  instability in time, which Pocock calls the "Machiavellian moment."After
  examining this problem in the works of Machiavelli, Guicciardini, and
  Giannotti, Pocock turns to the revival of republican ideology in Puritan
  England and in Revolutionary and Federalist America. He argues that the
  American Revolution can be considered the last great act of civic humanism of
  the Renaissance and he relates the origins of modern historicism to the clash
  between civic, Christian, and commercial values in eighteenth-century
  thought.This Princeton Classics edition of The Machiavellian Moment features
  a new introduction by Richard Whatmore.%

    `If in this book harsh words are spoken about some of the greatest among
  the intellectual leaders of mankind, my motive is not, I hope, to belittle
  them. It springs rather from my conviction that, if our civilization is to
  survive, we must break with the habit of deference to great men.' - Karl
  Popper, from the Preface Written in political exile during the Second World
  War and first published in two volumes in 1945, Karl Popper's The Open
  Society and Its Enemies is one of the most influential books of all time.
  Hailed by Bertrand Russell as a `vigorous and profound defence of democracy',
  its now legendary attack on the philosophies of Plato, Hegel and Marx exposed
  the dangers inherent in centrally planned political systems and through
  underground editions become an inspiration to lovers of freedom living under
  communism in Eastern Europe. Popper's highly accessible style, his erudite
  and lucid explanations of the thoughts of great philosophers and the recent
  resurgence of totalitarian regimes around the world are just three of the
  reasons for the enduring popularity of The Open Society and Its Enemies and
  why it demands to be read today and in years to come.%

    Language consists of dispositions, socially instilled, to respond
  observably to socially observable stimuli. Such is the point of view from
  which a noted philosopher and logician examines the notion of meaning and the
  linguistic mechanisms of objective reference. In the course of the
  discussion, Professor Quine pinpoints the difficulties involved in
  translation, brings to light the anomalies and conflicts implicit in our
  language's referential apparatus, clarifies semantic problems connected with
  the imputation of existence, and marshals reasons for admitting or
  repudiating each of various categories of supposed objects. He argues that
  the notion of a language-transcendent "sentence-meaning" must on the whole be
  rejected; meaningful studies in the semantics of reference can only be
  directed toward substantially the same language in which they are conducted.%

    BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new
  state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic
  textual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed
  into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the
  most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50
  million inference computations (\textasciitilde 65 hours) with BERT. The
  construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as
  well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we
  present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network
  that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically
  meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity.
  This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with
  BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy
  from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer
  learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence
  embeddings methods.%

    Word embeddings, the coefficients from neural network models predicting the
  use of words in context, have now become inescapable in applications
  involving natural language processing. Despite a few studies in political
  science, the potential of this methodology for the analysis of political
  texts has yet to be fully uncovered. This paper introduces models of word
  embeddings augmented with political metadata and trained on large-scale
  parliamentary corpora from Britain, Canada, and the United States. We fit
  these models with indicator variables of the party affiliation of members of
  parliament, which we refer to as party embeddings. We illustrate how these
  embeddings can be used to produce scaling estimates of ideological placement
  and other quantities of interest for political research. To validate the
  methodology, we assess our results against indicators from the Comparative
  Manifestos Project, surveys of experts, and measures based on roll-call
  votes. Our findings suggest that party embeddings are successful at capturing
  latent concepts such as ideology, and the approach provides researchers with
  an integrated framework for studying political language.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Equally at home in economic theory and political philosophy, John Roemer
  has written a unique book that critiques economists' conceptions of justice
  from a philosophical perspective and philosophical theories of distributive
  justice from an economic one. He unites the economist's skill in constructing
  precise, axiomatic models with the philosopher's in exploring the assumptions
  of those models. His synthesis will enable philosophers and economists to
  engage each other's ideas more fruitfully.Roemer first shows how economists'
  understanding of the fairness of various resource allocation mechanisms can
  be enriched. He extends the economic theory of social choice to show how
  individual preferences can be aggregated into social preferences over various
  alternatives. He critiques the standard applications of axiomatic bargaining
  theory to distributive justice, showing that they ignore information on
  available resources and preference orderings. He puts these variables in the
  models, which enable him to generate resource allocation mechanisms that are
  more consonant with our intuitions about distributive justice. He then
  critiques economists' theories of utilitarianism and examines the question of
  the optimal population size in a world of finite resources.Roemer explores
  the major new philosophical concepts of the theory of distributive
  justice--primary goods, functionings and capability, responsibility in its
  various forms, procedural versus outcome justice, midfare--and shows how they
  can be sharpened and clarified with the aid of economic analysis. He
  critiques and extends the ideas of major contemporary theories of
  distributive justice, including those of Rawls, Sen, Nozick, and Dworkin.
  Beginning from the recent theories of Arneson and G. A. Cohen, he constructs
  a theory of equality of opportunity. Theories of Distributive Justice
  contains important and original results, and it can also be used as a
  graduate-level text in economics and philosophy.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Schools of Thought brings together a cast of prominent scholars to assess,
  with unprecedented breadth and vigor, the intellectual revolution over the
  past quarter century in the social sciences. This collection of twenty essays
  stems from a 1997 conference that celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of
  the Institute for Advanced Study's School of Social Science. The authors, who
  represent a wide range of disciplines, are all associated with the School's
  emphasis on interpretive social science, which rejects models from the hard
  sciences and opts instead for a humanistic approach to social inquiry.
  Following a preface by Clifford Geertz, whose profound insights have helped
  shape the School from the outset, the essays are arranged in four sections.
  The first offers personal reflections on disciplinary changes; the second
  features essays advocating changes in focus or methodology; the third
  presents field overviews and institutional history; while the fourth
  addresses the link between political philosophy and world governance. Two
  recurring themes are the uses (and pitfalls) of interdisciplinary studies and
  the relation between scholarship and social change. This book will be
  rewarding for anyone interested in how changing trends in scholarship shape
  the understanding of our social worlds. The contributors include David Apter,
  Kaushik Basu, Judith Butler, Nicholas Dirks, Jean Elshtain, Peter Galison,
  Wolf Lepenies, Jane Mansbridge, Andrew Pickering, Mary Poovey, Istvan Rev,
  Renato Rosaldo, Michael Rustin, Joan W. Scott, William H. Sewell, Jr.,

    The past quarter of a century has seen dramatic developments in social and
  political thought. These essays offer an indispensable introduction to some
  of the most influential amongst them. Quentin Skinner's Introduction traces
  broad transformations such as the erosion of empiricist assumptions and the
  undermining of the positivist ideal of the unification of the sciences by the
  impact of foreign traditions on English-speaking social science. The essays
  themselves discuss major figures such as Gadamer, Derrida, Foucault,
  Habermas, Althusser and Levi-Strauss, giving valuably lucid introductory
  studies of some difficult but unquestionably major thinkers of our time.

    This extended essay by one of the world's leading historians seeks, in its
  first part, to excavate, and to vindicate, the neo-Roman theory of free
  citizens and free states as it developed in early-modern Britain. This
  analysis leads on to a powerful defence of the nature, purposes and goals of
  intellectual history and the history of ideas. As Quentin Skinner says, 'the
  intellectual historian can help us to appreciate how far the values embodied
  in our present way of life, and our present ways of thinking about those
  values, reflect a series of choices made at different times between different
  possible worlds'. This essay thus provides one of the most substantial
  statements yet made about the importance, relevance and potential excitement
  of this form of historical enquiry. Liberty before Liberalism is based on
  Quentin Skinner's Inaugural Lecture as Regius Professor of Modern History in
  the University of Cambridge, delivered in November 1997. Professor Skinner

    Quentin Skinner is one of the foremost historians in the world, and in
  Hobbes and Republican Liberty he offers a dazzling comparison of two rival
  theories about the nature of human liberty. The first originated in classical
  antiquity, and lay at the heart of the Roman republican tradition of public
  life. Thomas Hobbes was the most formidable enemy of this pattern of thought,
  and his successive attempts to discredit it constitute a truly epochal moment
  in the history of Anglophone political thought. Hobbes and Republican Liberty
  develops several of the themes announced by Quentin Skinner in his celebrated
  inaugural lecture on Liberty before Liberalism of 1997. Cogent, engaged,
  accessible, and indeed exhilarating, this new book will appeal to readers of
  history, politics, and philosophy at all levels from upper-undergraduate
  upwards, and provides an excellent introduction to the work of one of the
  most celebrated thinkers of our time.%

    In 1996 physicist Alan Sokal published an essay in Social Text--an
  influential academic journal of cultural studies--touting the deep
  similarities between quantum gravitational theory and postmodern philosophy.
  Soon thereafter, the essay was revealed as a brilliant parody, a catalog of
  nonsense written in the cutting-edge but impenetrable lingo of postmodern
  theorists. The event sparked a furious debate in academic circles and made
  the headlines of newspapers in the U.S. and abroad.In Fashionable Nonsense:
  Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science, Sokal and his fellow physicist
  Jean Bricmont expand from where the hoax left off. In a delightfully witty
  and clear voice, the two thoughtfully and thoroughly dismantle the
  pseudo-scientific writings of some of the most fashionable French and
  American intellectuals. More generally, they challenge the widespread notion
  that scientific theories are mere "narrations" or social constructions.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The abolitionist movement of the nineteenth-century United States remains
  among the most significant social and political movements in US history.
  Abolitionist newspapers played a crucial role in spreading information and
  shaping public opinion around a range of issues relating to the abolition of
  slavery. These newspapers also serve as a primary source of information about
  the movement for scholars today, resulting in powerful new accounts of the
  movement and its leaders. This paper supplements recent qualitative work on
  the role of women in abolition's vanguard, as well as the role of the Black
  press, with a quantitative text modeling approach. Using diachronic word
  embeddings, we identify which newspapers tended to lead lexical semantic
  innovations \textemdash{} the introduction of new usages of specific words
  \textemdash{} and which newspapers tended to follow. We then aggregate the
  evidence across hundreds of changes into a weighted network with the
  newspapers as nodes; directed edge weights represent the frequency with which
  each newspaper led the other in the adoption of a lexical semantic change.
  Analysis of this network reveals pathways of lexical semantic influence,
  distinguishing leaders from followers, as well as others who stood apart from
  the semantic changes that swept through this period. More specifically, we
  find that two newspapers edited by women -- The Provincial Freeman and The
  Lily -- led a large number of semantic changes in our corpus, lending
  additional credence to the argument that a multiracial coalition of women led
  the abolitionist movement in terms of both thought and action. It also
  contributes additional complexity to the scholarship that has sought to tease
  apart the relation of the abolitionist movement to the women's suffrage
  movement, and the vexed racial politics that characterized their relation.%

  world and in Germany in the first half of the nineteenth century. The book
  has three interrelated purposes. First, it constitutes the first synthetic
  description and comprehensive reconstruction of the historical genesis and
  humanist transformation of Hegelian ideology. Secondly, the study addresses
  the problem of recurrent patterns of hope and disillusionment in the
  successive phases of dialectical thought. Finally, the book is concerned with
  ideological responses to the experience of communal and religious
  disintegration.%

    Quentin Skinner is one of the leading thinkers in the social sciences and
  humanities today. Since the publication of his first important articles some
  two decades ago, debate has continued to develop over his distinctive
  contributions to contemporary political philosophy, the history of political
  theory, the philosophy of social science, and the discussion of
  interpretation and hermeneutics across the humanities and social sciences.
  Nevertheless, his most valuable essays and the best critical articles
  concerning his work have been scattered in various journals and difficult to
  obtain. Meaning and Context includes five of the most widely discussed
  articles by Skinner, which present his approach to the study of political
  thought and the interpretation of texts. Following these are seven articles
  by his critics, five of these drawn from earlier publications and two, by
  John Keane and Charles Taylor, written especially for this volume. Finally,
  there appears a fifty-seven page reply by Skinner--a major new statement in
  which he defends and reformulates his method and lays out new lines of
  research. The editorial introduction provides a systematic overview of the
  evolution of Skinner's work and of the main reactions to it. Besides James
  Tully, John Keane, and Charles Taylor, the contributors include Joseph V.
  Femia, Keith Graham, Martin Hollis, Kenneth Minogue, and Nathan Tarcov.%

    In this paper, we introduce personalized word embeddings, and examine their
  value for language modeling. We compare the performance of our proposed
  prediction model when using personalized versus generic word representations,
  and study how these representations can be leveraged for improved
  performance. We provide insight into what types of words can be more
  accurately predicted when building personalized models. Our results show that
  a subset of words belonging to specific psycholinguistic categories tend to
  vary more in their representations across users and that combining generic
  and personalized word embeddings yields the best performance, with a 4.7\%
  relative reduction in perplexity. Additionally, we show that a language model
  using personalized word embeddings can be effectively used for authorship

    Recently, the use of word embedding models (WEM) has received ample
  attention in the natural language processing community. These models can
  capture semantic information in large corpora of text by learning
  distributional properties of words, that is how often particular words appear
  in specific contexts. Scholars have pointed out the potential of WEMs for
  historical research. In particular, their ability to capture semantic change
  might assist historians studying conceptual change or specific discursive
  formations over time. Concurrently, others voiced their criticism and pointed
  out that WEMs require large amounts of training data, that they are
  challenging to evaluate, and they lack the specificity looked for by
  historians. The ability to examine semantic change resonates with the goals
  of historians such as Reinhart Koselleck, whose research focused on the
  formation of concepts and the transformation of semantic fields. However,
  word embeddings can only be used to study particular types of semantic
  change, and the model's use is dependent on the size, quality, and bias in
  training data. In this article, we examine what is required of historical
  data to produce reliable WEMs, and we describe the types of questions that
  can be answered using WEMs.%

    How strongly should you believe the various propositions that you can
  express? That is the key question facing Bayesian epistemology. Subjective
  Bayesians hold that it is largely (though not entirely) up to the agent as to
  which degrees of belief to adopt. Objective Bayesians, on the other hand,
  maintain that appropriate degrees of belief are largely (though not entirely)
  determined by the agent's evidence. This book states and defends a version of
  objective Bayesian epistemology. According to this version, objective
  Bayesianism is characterized by three norms: {$\cdot$} Probability - degrees
  of belief should be probabilities {$\cdot$} Calibration - they should be
  calibrated with evidence {$\cdot$} Equivocation - they should otherwise
  equivocate between basic outcomes Objective Bayesianism has been challenged
  on a number of different fronts. For example, some claim it is poorly
  motivated, or fails to handle qualitative evidence, or yields
  counter-intuitive degrees of belief after updating, or suffers from a failure
  to learn from experience. It has also been accused of being computationally
  intractable, susceptible to paradox, language dependent, and of not being
  objective enough. Especially suitable for graduates or researchers in
  philosophy of science, foundations of statistics and artificial intelligence,
  the book argues that these criticisms can be met and that objective
  Bayesianism is a promising theory with an exciting agenda for further
  research.%

    This renewed edition of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, exactly a
  century after Wittgenstein's release, presents the text in a hierarchical
  manner, ``which is the way in which the book was composed and in which
  Wittgenstein arranged (selected and supplemented) the best of the
  philosophical remarks that he had been writing since 1913'' (Peter Hacker).
  That tree-like reading is recommended by Wittgenstein himself in the sole
  footnote of his book, in which he suggests that the inner logical structure
  of the text is set by the decimal numbers of its propositions. ``They alone
  \textendash{} the Author will add \textendash{} give the book perspicuity and
  clearness, and without this numbering it would be an incomprehensible
  jumble''. Indeed, the compact and intricate sequence of the traditional
  presentation is only a rigorous logical bet, but only a logical machine or a
  robot can unravel the tangle: for an ordinary human understanding that does
  not exploit its numbering, the book remains ``an incomprehensible jumble''.
  In the present disposition, instead, all horizontal and vertical references
  become directly manifest and any reader can enjoy the fine architecture and
  the elegant reasoning of Wittgenstein's work. Every page is an actual reading
  unit, perfectly coherent and complete. The Tractatus becomes comprehensible
  also to unskilled readers, of course at more or less deep levels, while a
  scholar or a more practised reader can detect suggestions and meanings that
  had remained, until now, completely hidden. A historical note shows in which
  manner the new structural perspective sheds new light also in the
  compositional manuscript we have, which ``writing units'' are very similar,
  actually, to the pages of the present edition. Besides, this allows to
  rebuild the list of ``Supplements'' (here in the Appendix) that Wittgenstein
  gathered after he roughly finished his manuscript, but that he used very
  little in the final book. Printing the Tractatus following Wittgenstein's
  decimal prescriptions required meticulous philological care and some
  discretional conventions: for instance, at the top of each page the
  commented-upon proposition is printed again, to make the sight complete and
  self-sufficient. On the other hand, some forcing of the text by the
  translators in their sequential reading could be eliminated, restoring a more
  literal translation. Also the famous and intriguing picture of the eye and
  its visual field (5.6331) has been restored as Wittgenstein drafted it,
  making the entire page perfectly understandable and coherent. This documented
  and editorial work on one of the most referenced books of the last century
  was conceived to obtain, and in fact gained, a perspicuous and crystal clear
  text, philologically faithful and relaxingly readable at the same time.%

    Plato's Epistles are among the most disputed texts of antiquity. Were they
  written by Plato? Some of them? all? none? Answers have varied wildly: at
  times all thirteen have been declared forgeries, alien to the thought and
  character of the Plato we know from the dialogues; at other times, the whole
  set has been accepted as a genuine, if unexpected, revelation of the life and
  preoccupations of Plato as a man. Since this debate has so far proved
  intractable, I would like to take a different approach to the question. The
  Epistles themselves raise obsessively the question of authenticity. If,
  laying aside all issues of provenance for the time being, we read the
  thirteen letters as a corpus (whether by Plato or someone else), what emerges
  from this philosophical `text' is the impossibility of an authentic written
  philosophy and of an authoritative self-present philosopher.%

    In this groundbreaking work, Ellen Meiksins Wood rewrites the history of
  political theory. She traces the development of the Western tradition from
  classical antiquity through to the Middle Ages in the perspective of social
  history\textemdash a significant departure not only from the standard
  abstract history of ideas but also from other contextual methods. Treating
  canonical thinkers as passionately engaged human beings, Wood examines their
  ideas not simply in the context of political languages but as creative
  responses to the social relations and conflicts of their time and place. She
  identifies a distinctive relation between property and state in Western
  history and shows how the canon, while largely the work of members or clients
  of dominant classes, was shaped by complex interactions among proprietors,
  labourers and states. Western political theory, Wood argues, owes much of its
  vigour, and also many ambiguities, to these complex and often contradictory
  relations. From the Ancient Greek polis of Plato, Aristotle, Aeschylus and
  Sophocles, through the Roman Republic of Cicero and the Empire of St Paul and
  St Augustine, to the medieval world of Averroes, Thomas Aquinas and William
  of Ockham, Citizens to Lords offers a rich, dynamic exploration of thinkers

    \field{abstract}{%
    In 2006, Schoenberg, Wittgenstein, and the Vienna Circle received a Lewis
  Lockwood Award (Finalist) from the American Musicological Society, for
  outstanding new books on musicological topics. This study examines
  relativistic aspects of Arnold Schoenberg's harmonic and aesthetic theories
  in the light of a framework of ideas presented in the early writings of
  Ludwig Wittgenstein, the logician, philosopher of language, and Schoenberg's
  contemporary and Austrian compatriot. The author has identified
  correspondences between the writings of Schoenberg, the early Wittgenstein
  (the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, in particular), and the Vienna Circle of
  philosophers, on a wide range of topics and themes. Issues discussed include
  the nature and limits of language, musical universals, theoretical
  conventionalism, word-to-world correspondence in language, the need for a
  fact- and comparison-based approach to art criticism, and the nature of
  music-theoretical formalism and mathematical modeling. Schoenberg and
  Wittgenstein are shown to have shared a vision that is remarkable for its
  uniformity and balance, one that points toward the reconciliation of the
  positivist/relativist dualism that has dominated recent discourse in music
  theory. Contrary to earlier accounts of Schoenberg's harmonic and aesthetic
  relativism, this study identifies a solid epistemological core underlying his
  thought, a view that was very much in step with Wittgenstein and the Vienna
  Circle, and thereby with the most vigorous and pivotal developments in early
  twentieth century intellectual history%
